b" User is dog-paddling toward adulthood.  \nArmed with a useless BS in astrophysics and a pretty decent data plan, the recent college graduate's life might be in shambles, but at least she has plenty of time to browse dank memes. Her half-assed attempts to slay the  chaos dragon (and catch the attention of a local, possibly-autistic podiatrist) have been going relatively smoothly (relatively is a key word, here), until her best friend User points out that every User quiz they've taken seems to actually do what it claims to do. Guess their names? Check. Tell them their favorite 1D songs? Yup. \nWhen it becomes apparent that they have a chance to glimpse into their futures, one asinine quiz at a time,   User and User embark on a quest to do the impossible: find date-able boys in their Appalachian hometown.  While User has her cap set on 'emotional stability' and a '401k' and 'dental',   User appears to have an entirely different type of guy lined up for her next boyfriend, AND a one-month deadline to meet her soulmate.\nBut User won't be able to answer User 's most pressing question: can she date and get dumped by a stoner in time to meet her soulmate in 3 weeks?\nThere's no way her soulmate is going to be a pothead, right? \nRight?"b'The year started out weird, but things really took a turn for the bizarre when we discovered the Buzzfeed quizzes were coming true.\nIt seemed like a coincidence the first time.\n User planned a pool party and they guessed her age. She chose the flamingo float and the watermelon juice and the in-ground pool shaped like a figure eight. She texted me the screenshotted result, twenty-three, with an amused little caption:\n User actually got one right.\nWow. I texted back. Well, a broken clock is correct twice a day.\nI didn\'t think much of it. I slipped my phone into my left sweatpants pocket, brushed the cheddar and sour cream potato chip crumbs from my t-shirt, and went to the kitchen. Just as I had knelt and retrieved my nearly empty pickle jar from the bottom shelf, I felt my phone buzz.\n User had picked ten ice cream flavors, and they guessed her favorite 1D song.\n It\'s black magic. How did User know it was their version of "One Way or Another"? That\'s NOBODY\'S favorite 1D song.\n User has been my best friend for eight years. I know when she\'s being flakey.\nWow. I texted back. Well, a broken clock is correct twice a day.\nThis is creepy, User . Don\'t summarily invalidate my experiences.\nCoincidences are a statistical fact. I responded. Before she could start talking any hoodoo-voodoo stuff, I added: I was gonna finish my pickles, but I think I\'m craving ice cream now that you\'ve mentioned it.\nI set my phone on the kitchen counter, placed my pickle jar back in the fridge, and opened up the freezer door. As I was deciding between chocolate therapy and chocolate chip cookie dough, my phone buzzed again.\nFine. You try it. \nBeneath this, User had pasted the link to a Buzzfeed quiz.\nI was a scientist. Or at least I had majored in astrophysics at college. I was an unemployed scientist. I intended to prove to User that there was no such thing as black magic. And experimentation is the fourth step of the scientific method.\nI clicked the link and "bought" eight random things at Target:\nAn American flag print tank top (1)\nA User \'s cube (2)\nThe Mighty Mighty Bosstones\' third LP, Don\'t Know How To Party (3)\nA suitcase (4)\nA box of User watercolors (5)\nHalls Cough Drops (6)\nA pair of high waisted jorts (7)\nAnd\n User and User \'s baby shampoo (I have delicate scalp-skin) (8).\nMy screen jumped to the bottom of the page and saw my result.\nMy first name. Unusual, uncommon, and in black boldcase font, all caps, screaming in front of me:\nLEELA.\n User had correctly guessed my name from my mock Target shopping cart.\nAt that point, I was pretty surprised.\nMy phone buzzed in my hands. User wouldn\'t quit.\nDid you take it? What did you get?\nI wasn\'t going to admit a third coincidence, though I could have. User wouldn\'t take that well. So I decided to change the items in my shopping cart:\nA black knit crop top. A box of Scrabble. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\' fourth LP, Question the Answers. A different suitcase. A box of User crayons. Visine Eye Drops. A pair of black skinny jeans. A box of limited edition Cherry Jolly Rancher Pop Tarts.\nA completely different set of items.\nAnd yet.\nThere was my name, LEELA, in all caps, at the bottom of the screen.\nI sank to the kitchen floor.\nAs User texted me incessantly for the next hour, I exhausted every possible permutation for every possible item choice in the damn quiz. Each time I was met with my name. LEELA. As if User itself were mocking me. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. LEELA. User .\nLEELA.\nLEELA.\nLEELA. \nLike the chanting of a schoolyard bully.\nLEELA.\nI wondered how such a thing could be possible. This was chaos. This was disorder. This was terrifying. My hands were already shaking when I opened User \'s text messages. The latest was the most gruesome.\nA single, uncaptioned screenshot:\nPUT EIGHT RANDOM THINGS IN YOUR TARGET SHOPPING CART AND WE\'LL User GUESS YOUR FIRST NAME.\nAnd her result, in black boldcase:\n User .\nNow I had absolutely no idea what was going on with the world.\n***'b'It was no secret the post-college life had been rough on me.\nIf it weren\'t for the fact that User had been receiving the same, strange User results, I would have thought that maybe I had hallucinated them.\nI graduated in December. It was now June. And I had done nothing.\nI hadn\'t been sleeping well. I hadn\'t been eating well. Most days, the only human interaction I enjoyed, if I enjoyed anything at all, was the short conversations I\'d have with my brother at dinner, when he\'d return home from his IT job at the call center. We\'d talk about the president and the protests and how weird the world was getting as we\'d huddle over our ramen, like refugees from the last sane years of the past century. We wouldn\'t ever talk about what happened to Mom in January, or if Dad would have sued her oncologist. The house was now empty except for us two. We had learned that ghosts are best left in the ground, unbothered. \nIt was on special days, my favorite days, that I got to see User . The days she\'d get off. She worked as a nurse at one of the local hospitals. Not the one Mom died in, which was a small blessing. I fucking hate that place, and never want to be reminded of it ever again. Not that User \'s hospital was much better. When User started nursing school, she made a point to tell me that hospitals aren\'t like User . By this January, though, I had long lost whatever fantasy I once held of her workplace- fast-talking internists who dispensed increasingly inventive insults, musical numbers in the OR, doctors who did more than pop into hospital rooms and casually tell people they were dying.\nIt only takes one traumatic major life event to knock the fantasy out of you.\nOf course, now that User had finished orientation, she\'d only have a couple days off a week. The rest of our friends had fled our hometown, for plusher, more metropolitan pastures, where you might actually find snappy, resume-plumping jobs with a liberal arts degree, and young, semi-attractive men.\nWhere User and I were stuck, we had no such luck. \nAnd on a June Thursday afternoon, in our town, the only males at the local shopping mall were well under the age of eighteen or over forty, with children at their ankles.\n"You know what I think you need?" User paused to maneuver the frozen banana into her mouth. As she bit into it, its chocolate shell cracked and fell to her Birkenstocks. A couple of teenage boys loitering outside the User \'s snickered. She threw up her free middle finger and they scurried past the fidget spinner stand to the hellish depths of User , like rodents, like the frightened mall rats they were.\n"Suicide pills?" I asked.\n"A job." User licked the small glob of chocolate that had melted onto the left  corner of her lips. "Heard back from the California observatory yet?"\n"Rejection." I said, but it didn\'t sting. It was a lark that I had even applied for the opening at the Griffith Observatory. Nobody even did any actual science there. The position was a part-time tour guide. The perk was that I\'d be able to go to the top of the place at night and look down at all LA\'s glowing orange lights and pretend I was in Blade Runner. I was basically a replicant already. That kind of view, every night, could soothe my anxious, android-brain. \n"What about the South Mountain one?" \n"Rejection," I said, and this time it did sting. SM Observatory was local, owned by the astrophysics department of my alma mater, the hometown research university, and was a place where people did science. It paid peanuts, but at least I\'d be working.\n"I applied for an instructor job at the Newton Science Center," I popped a User peanut butter smidgen into my mouth, "it\'s User , but it\'s all I got left. It\'s been almost a month though, so I probably won\'t hear back.."\n"Never know," User said, but there wasn\'t any hope in her voice. "How\'s things going with User ?"\nI didn\'t want to talk about User . \nWe stepped onto an escalator.\n"Nothing new then?" User struggled to keep her banana on its stick.\n"I\'m starting to seriously believe he\'s an objectosexual." I said, a little too loud, before noticing the bouncing twin toddlers a few steps in front of us. \n"Objecto-what?" User snorted.\n"I mean, he\'s getting up there," I said, "You\'d think that by now he\'d want more out of life than just his car, right?"\n"Maybe not," User shrugged. "Maybe he doesn\'t want to ever get married or have a family or-"\n"That\'s what I\'m worried about," I said, and winced because I knew I still had a crush on him. "He\'s five years away from forty for fuck\'s sake-"\n"I hate to interrupt," the father of the bouncing twin toddlers a few steps in front of us had turned around and locked eyes with me. \nAnd then I was certain my big, filthy mouth had offended him. I didn\'t even know why I bothered to apply for that instructor position the Newton Science Center. I\'d be fired before the end of my first shift. \nI opened my mouth to apologize.\n"Forty sneaks up on you." He said. His blue eyes were bloodshot and underscored with purplish bags. \n"Waa?" I uttered, like I had just woken up and couldn\'t formulate English words.\n"What?" User asked for me.\n"Forty sneaks up on you," the father repeated. "You\'re twenty-two one day," his gaze dropped to my feet and immediately bounced back to my eyes, as if to say, I\'m literally talking about you, "and then you\'re forty the next." The escalator step on which he stood reached the bottom floor and he grabbed one of his toddler\'s hands. "Take it from someone who\'s been there."\nAnd he and his children disappeared beyond the Starbucks and into the Chick Fil A.\n"Oh Lordy," User couldn\'t contain herself as we walked out the mall doors. "He totally thought you were actually dating User , and like, pushing for marriage."\n"Waa?" I uttered.\n"He was trying to defend poor User ," User giggled, "poor, weird User ."\nI was glad User could see the humor in the situation. Because all I could see in the escalator man\'s tired eyes was the inescapable forward march of time and the icy grip of existential dread. Tomorrow I could be forty, and with nothing to show for it at all. \n User chose a bench in the shade, over looking the crosswalk to outdoor shops and the parking lot. We sat down. She nibbled what remained of her banana.\n"What am I gonna do?" I stared at the User across the street and also at nothing at all.\n"We could ask User ?" User suggested. "There\'s got to be a quiz about where you\'re going to find a man, or a job, or something?"\n"NO!" I reflexively knocked the frozen banana stick out of her hand. "I don\'t really want to know!" \n"Dafuck dude," User stared at the banana melting on the sidewalk, "now what am I gonna eat?"\n***'b'"So, User ," I said, and pretended that someone, anyone once found me sexy, "here we are again."\n User couldn\'t even look at me.\nI\'m not a model. I know this. But I\'m probably a solid seven out of ten. I\'m something of a butterface, but I\'m not a complete butterface. I\'ve got a little of that \'fetal alcohol syndrome\' look, but it\'s not a severe case. \nAnd even if it were a severe case, and I were a complete butterface, that just isn\'t the way you treat a person. You look at them when they are talking to you. \n"She\'s beautiful, isn\'t she," User sighed. "Ethereally, awesomely beautiful."\nThe car cover in his hands trembled and he dropped it to the cement floor. The dry heat of the garage struck me, and immediately I was confused. We were in a garage. The damn thing was parked in a garage. Why did it need a cover?\n"Just look at these sweet doors," User smoothed his square fingers along its stainless steel body. \nIt hadn\'t struck me as weird until last week.\nSometimes you\'d see people act this way about a Maserati. User could afford one, too. Podiatrists make a decent salary, and he hadn\'t an ex-wife or any kids to support. That wasn\'t why I was so desperately attracted to him. I\'m not a gold digger, though sometimes I felt like it. I\'m not sure what else people would find conventionally appealing about the man. He was short and chunky, with a baby face and ruddy skin. I\'m not sure what it was that I found so appealing about him, either, but I couldn\'t shake it. Maybe it was his completely placid professional demeanor. I had met him in March, when I still struggled to confront the vacuum of post-grad life: the structure of college now fallen away, the staccato chaos of acute grief, the political uncertainty that day-by-day became less a horror show than a farce.\nIt was at the end of January that I had watched a self-help video from some professor of clinical psychology on YouTube. He told me, in a thick Minnesotan accent, that I must slay the little dragons of my life before I could even dream of vanquishing the big ones. \nSo I scheduled a cleaning at the dentist and an appointment at the podiatrist, to do something about my plantar warts.\nI saw User . His office was an oasis of stability. Nobody died at the podiatrist. He moved slowly, talked softly, and looked young for his age. I thought I was crazy for wondering if he were single. When User found his Facebook and determined without a doubt that he was, I first thought I was insanely lucky. Then, I began to think I was just plain insane for wondering if he\'d disregard all ethical standards and date me.\nMy opportunity to get to know User personally arose on a late April Thursday, while he applied liquid nitrogen to the soles of my feet. He was talking in his calming, soft voice about the weather, I think, and I was too busy admiring his shoulders and his lavender dress shirt to pay attention to what exactly he was saying. My gaze fell to his tie, and then the pin stuck neatly in the middle of it. \n"Great Scott," I had said, in a way that I thought would be cute, "is that a User ?"\nI had never caught a guy\'s attention so quickly. \nNow, however, in User \'s garage, I was starting to wish I hadn\'t ever bothered.\n"I\'d like to take this baby back to 1985," User drooled.\n"Yeah," I said, "it\'s not actually a time machine, though."\n"Not yet," User opened the gull-wing doors, and sank into the driver\'s seat. "I\'m still working on the flux capacitor-"\n"Replica." I said.\n"What?" And for the first time since we had entered his garage, his eyes- his beautiful, light brown, sexy eyes- met mine.\n"Replica," I repeated myself. "The flux capacitor\'s a replica."\n"Oh yeah," and he was checking out the steering wheel, "made precisely according to Doc Brown\'s blue prints, which I have by the way. I got them at this year\'s Profiles in History Auction, can ya believe it?"\n"I can believe it." I said, and silently scolded myself for not specifying replica prop. As in, it\'s not real. User had to have known that. He was a scientist. More of a scientist than I was, even. And yet, somehow, I wasn\'t convinced that he did. \n"Yes sir, yes sir," User said, "I can sit here all day."\nThat was not an idle threat. He really could. He had done it before.\nI thought I was the sexiest woman to have ever endured plantar warts the day User asked for my email address. It was right after my last treatment. It seemed like a logical jumping point from which an unethical romantic relationship could spring forth. Sure, he was only going to send me the link to his blog about the User he was building. I didn\'t care. I thought it was cool. Back to the Future happened to be my favorite 80s movie franchise. It was his as well. His dedication to the project was mind-blowing. I had never been so dedicated to anything in my life. He had sourced every single part of the User . His goal was to obtain all of them over the course of his build, so that even the seat belt buckles would be screen accurate. \nIt had seemed to me, at the time, that he had this quiet ability to bring life to his personal vision of beauty and order in the fireball of turbulence the world around us had become. So be it that his personal vision of beauty and order was a replica time machine.\nI was completely in awe. \n I had broached the topic of meeting up in person extremely carefully. I framed it as that I wanted someday to see the car, what a cool project, such devotion and creativity etc. Imagine my great joy and surprise when he warmly invited me to "come over and see it whatever day [I] wanted" (given, of course, that he had off.)\nThat day was two weeks ago. I had spent hours picking out my clothing. What would make me look sexy, but not slutty. What would make me look like I wanted to date him, but not too much like I thought this meet-up constituted a date. I wore lipstick, but not red lipstick. \n That first day, we hung out in his garage for an hour and a half. He explained every single detail of the build. I was in heaven. Some of what he talked about required more technical knowledge to truly appreciate than what I had. I didn\'t mind. He had invited me to his house and I loved listening to him speak.\nHe offered me a Powerade afterwards. I didn\'t want to overstay my welcome, so I made up something about having to take User to the shop to pick up her Jeep after its oil change. He said if I wanted to hang out some more, he\'d be free again the next week.\nAnd I took him up on it.\nThat next Thursday, we hung out for another hour, again in his garage. It was less charming the second time. I wore red lipstick. He spent the date mostly on a mechanic\'s creeper, beneath the User \'s chassis, humming "The Power Of Love," Huey User \'s companion song to the original 1985 movie. No Powerade was offered. Instead, he cut the date short at the fifty minute mark, when he rolled out from under his car, stood up and announced that he needed to go to the auto part store and get a "higher precision drive torque wrench." He didn\'t ask me to tag along.\nI would have taken the hint, had he not emailed me when I got back from the mall yesterday, and asked if I wanted to hang out for a little. I thought maybe the last meet up was a one-off. I had HOPED that the last meet up was a one-off. \nWhen he led me back to his garage this afternoon, I felt my stomach drop.\n "Okay," I said, as User continued to play with his steering wheel. "You know I was thinking, maybe we could, I dunno, watch Back To The Future, like together."\n He seemed to consider this suggestion. And then he shook his head.\n " User ," User climbed out of the User and set down the doors. "I just watched it this morning. I don\'t think I wanna see it three times in a twenty-four hour period."\n"Let me get this straight. In the last 24 hours you watched the same movie, by yourself, twice?" I watched User pace around his User , like a pagan circling a sacred altar. \n" User ," User again shook his head, but didn\'t take his eyes off his car, "my dog was there." \nBefore I could respond, this happened:\n"I\'ve been meaning to marathon all three movies with my baby though," he lit up at this thought. \n"Your baby?" And it all made sense. I had been friend-zoned. He had a secret girlfriend. One not on Facebook. Probably a more attractive girl than me, probably smarter. He was so friendly because he had no intention of breaching ethics laws for me. It probably hadn\'t ever crossed his sweet little mind. \n"Yup," User looked around his garage\'s ceiling, "I wonder if I could hang a television in here. Can\'t drive her into the living room."\nOh God. \n"You\'re kidding, right?" I asked. I don\'t know what I was expecting. I don\'t think he heard me.\n"Would you look at that ass," he marveled at the User \'s rear bumper.\n" User ," I said. There must have been some change in my tone, because his gaze met my eyes.\n" User ," I repeated. I had enough. This was do or die. "Do you want to make out?"\nHis ruddy baby face flushed and he looked down at his feet. I still would have thought it was cute had I not thought I saw a trace of disgust cross over his face.\n"Jeeeze, Leela, I know you like to watch, but," he shook his head, "we\'re not gonna do that while you\'re here."\n***\nI sat in my car, in my driveway, for a good fifteen minutes, just staring at my phone. User had sent me a text message.\n      How did it go?\nI didn\'t know what to say. \nI had been rejected for a DMC-12 User . What can a person say about that?\nI ended up typing the first thing that came to my mind.\n      Ok. I give up. I\'ll ask User .\n***\nA/N: Too much? Tell me if it\'s too much.'b' User had suggested I go all in and find a "where will you meet your soulmate quiz."\nI wasn\'t going to do that. I think I was too scared User would confirm my suspicion that I wasn\'t the type of person who possessed a soulmate. That the jagged edges of my personality couldn\'t mesh with somebody else\'s. That my soul was made of corroded scrap metal. The kind you couldn\'t do anything with, not even make a half-heart charm for a friendship bracelet.\nThat was something I knew I couldn\'t deal with. At least, not right after leaving User \'s house. So instead, I started small.\n User four 80s movies and we\'ll tell you how you\'re life will be different next week.\nI like 80s movies, and the quiz was only threatening to reveal the events of seven days into my future. How drastically different, I thought, could my life be in seven days?\nFor the sci-fi movie, I picked User .\nFor the action movie, I picked The Terminator.\nFor the rom-com, I picked Pretty in Pink.\nFor the comedy, I just had to pick Back to the Future.\nAnd then, I held my breath as my screen jumped to the results.\nTen words. Black font.\nYou will be working that new job you applied for. It took me a minute to remember that the only job I had applied for and still hadn\'t officially heard back from was the educator position at the Newton Science Center\'s new planetarium. But it had been a month since I sent my resume. I was under the impression it was a no. If you don\'t hear from somebody for a month, they really don\'t care about you.\nMy phone buzzed in my hands, and I jumped.\nA text message. From User . I exhaled.\nSo. What\'s the future hold?\nI screenshotted my result and began to type out my reply:\nI don\'t think User is still working. I don\'t have a job application out atm.\nBut before I could hit send, my phone buzzed again in my hands. A phone call. From a number I didn\'t recognize, except that the area code was local. I didn\'t want to accept it, but this itchy part of my brain made sure that I did.\n"Uh, yeah?" I said.\n"Is this Leela Pendurthi?" A woman on the other end asked.\n"Uh, yeah," I replied.\n"Leela, this is Dr. User ," she spoke very quickly, "director of education at the Newton Science Center. I\'ve just reviewed your resume and you appear to have adequate credentials for our open planetarium educator position. Would you be available tomorrow afternoon for an in-person interview?"\n"Uh," I wanted to say no, and prove User impossible. But the pull of some stable, science-related income was irresistible. "Yeah." I said instead.\n"Excellent," Dr. User said, "I\'ll see you in my office, tomorrow, at 2:30."\n"Yeah, okay," I answered Dr. User \'s non-question before I realized she had hung up.\nI stared through my windshield at the garage door.\nIt had just begun to rain when my phone buzzed again in my hands and I jumped again in my seat.\nA text message, from User :\nCome on. Whatever the result was, it can\'t be that bad. \n***'b'The year started out weird. You know that.\nThis past February, it got up to seventy-five degrees. I put away my snow boots and found my tank tops and my running shorts in my dresser, and User and I took a drive about forty minutes out of town to this spot of Appalachian desolation. There\'s a ledge on a mountain out there that juts out over a huge swath of countryside. In the summer, teenagers like to climb up to that ledge and sit and drink and consider their lives and their future prospects and talk loudly about things the adult world has gotten too old understand.\nSince User and I are overgrown teenagers, we climbed up onto that ledge, swung our feet over the edge and pretended we were still seventeen. Because it was February, the kids were still in school. We were one-month out of graduation then, and not even looking for work yet. We could afford to be there alone. The country was singularly quiet. You couldn\'t even hear a bird song. The patchwork fields below us were dead, brown and gray. The forested mountainside was purplish: you could see the brush-stroke trunks and the bare branches of trees that hadn\'t yet budded this year\'s canopy. And maybe it was the dissonance of the summer sun on our bare shoulders and the sight of the winter beneath our dangling feet that confused my mind- but the earth looked somehow inviting to me. I felt as if I could spring myself from that ledge and fall into a fuzzy purple blanket. I wondered if somehow the plunge wouldn\'t have killed me, should I have jumped.\nIf User hadn\'t been there, I think I might have jumped.\nThe French have a name for that feeling- the call of the void. When you wonder what it might feel like to completely destroy yourself.\nIt\'s not suicidal ideation. You don\'t actually want to die. You just want to know what it feels like.\nIt\'s an involuntary curiosity.\nAnd it\'s something I battle a lot.\nFor example. At 2:30 this afternoon, I heard the call of the void in Dr. User office, in the north wing of the second floor of the Newton Science center.\nDr. User \'s a short woman with ruddy cheeks and auburn hair. She talks very quickly, has a slight Spanish accent, and the Colombian flag hanging on the wall behind her large, dark cherry wood desk. While she talked about the importance of public science education, and the dwindling earth and environmental science programs in our district\'s schools, all I could think about is what would happen if I kicked off my User heels and stretched my legs out over the side of that desk.\nMy hypothesis was that she would be baffled, and either ask me to put down my feet or, more likely, just end the interview that moment and demand I leave the premises. Whatever the case, I would not get the job at the Newton Science center\'s new planetarium.\nOr would I?\nI started to wonder if the Buzzfeed quizzes worked like the McFly\'s family photograph in Back to the Future. Would my quiz results change with my actions? Was the future predestined, or was there such a thing as free will? This was a question that had confounded theologians and philosophers and scientists and filmmakers since time immemorial. And I realized, as I stared at Dr. User \'s rapidly-moving lips, I had something none of those theologians and philosophers and scientists had. The chance to answer this question scientifically. I had the chance to do some very real science.\nAnd what kind of real science would I be doing at the Newton Center anyway?\nI took a deep breath and stuck up my left index finger.\n"I\'m gonna have to stop you there, Doc," I said, and kicked off my heels. "I haven\'t been listening to a word you\'ve been staying."\nAnd then I set my feet on the edge of Dr. User \'s cherry wood desk.\nFor a moment, I thought Dr. User \'s head might have popped off her neck. Her right eyelid opened and shut almost imperceptibly quickly and the corners of her smile twitched.\n"I suppose I do I have a tendency to ramble on about things no one cares about," she said, and kept her gaze rigid on my eyes and away from my feet, "at least that\'s my husband says."\n"He\'s not wrong." I pretended there was some food stuck between my teeth and picked at my incisor with my thumbnail, "what is this place, anyway?"\nI watched Dr. User \'s gaze briefly fall to my mouth. She shuddered.\n"The only reason why I\'d even consider a job in your joke of a planetarium is because I\'ve already hit rock bottom." That should do it, I figured. Dump on her career, dump on the job, dump on the new planetarium.\n"Rock bottom?" Dr. User repeated.\n"Is there an echo?" I wondered why she hadn\'t called security. "I could be working for NASA, you know, if it weren\'t for these fat-cats in Washington. Women finally get enough education to become astrophysicists, and now they want to dismantle the whole damn space program. Have you ever seen Hidden Figures?" I didn\'t let her answer. "It\'s just like that."\nDr. User blinked. The superiority and persecution complexes had to be enough to get me kicked out of there.\n"You\'re very, uh," Dr. User stammered, "honest?"\n"Actually, half the shit on my resume I made up." I was now getting concerned. Dr. User seemed disgusted, but she also didn\'t seem to want to do anything about it. I had visions of the fates from ancient myth, spinning the story of my life completely without any input from me at all. "I never technically graduated from college. I refused to get my meningitis shot because vaccines are the devil\'s work, so the stupid administrators wouldn\'t let me walk. Red tape, I tell ya."\n"Really?" Dr. User gaped, "that shows, uh, conviction-"\n"I don\'t have any," I waved my hands, "the trick is to get an excellent defense lawyer. I should really be a felon by now."\n"Oh," Dr. User nodded.\n"Yeah, mostly small things. I\'ve killed a few of my neighbors\' cats here and there," I watched Dr. User bend over in her chair and open a lower desk drawer. "Sometimes I like to purposely drive over people\'s mailboxes," I said, as Dr. User pulled out a glass flask filled with an amber liquid and a tumbler and set them on her desk. "One time, I punched a homeless man in the back of the head, just to say I did it-" I watched her pour herself a drink, down it, and pour herself another. She looked at me before she took a gulp.\n"Is there anything else you\'d like me to know about you?"\n"Yeah," I squinted. "I\'m not actually a sex offender, but sometimes I think I could be one, you know?"\n***\nDr. User said she would \'let me know.\'\nI was walking through the parking lot to my car, my eyes fixated on my phone, my fingers scrolling through User \'s quiz section as quickly I as could move them.\nJust as I had clicked on the link to the Pick four 80s movies and we\'ll tell you how you\'re life will be different next week quiz, my phone rang. Dr. User .\n"Hi Dr. User , good to hear from you," I said, but I was annoyed she had interrupted my experiment. I just wanted her to reject me so I could get off the phone already and test my hypothesis. "Before you say anything, I want you to know that I understand completely-"\n"Leela, I want you to take the job." Dr. User said, flatly.\n"What?"\n"I need you to take the job. It was my idea to build a planetarium and the astrophysicist I had on board got a TV show in Japan and I haven\'t been able to fill the damn spot for six months. I need someone with an astrophysics degree, and I need someone now or the board of executives is going to have my ass."\nI couldn\'t speak.\n"I\'m going to be honest with you," Dr. User continued, "my life is in shambles and I have nothing to live for. If you don\'t take this fucking job, I\'m going to fucking kill myself."\nI still couldn\'t speak.\n"I can\'t have the board of executives on my ass again, User ." Dr. User was now actually sobbing. "I\'m going to fucking kill myself. So are you gonna take the fucking job or not?"\nI thought about the mountain ledge and the call of the void.\nI don\'t want to kill myself, I just wanted to know what it feels like.\nI don\'t want to be a sociopath, I just wanted to act like one.\n"Uh, wow, Dr. User ," I heard myself say, "I\'ll take the job. Don\'t kill yourself."\n***'b'"All I\'m saying is you can\'t prove that the earth orbits the sun."\nAnd with that, User cackled, self-satisfied, like she were a prosecutor who had just hit defense with a final, fatal blow. The headache I had then made me want to detach the damn thing from my neck and clobber her with it.\n" User ," I said, as I punched the User button on the breakroom microwave, "why do you work at a science center?"\n"You can\'t prove it, can you?" This stupid grin spread across User \'s chubby, middle-aged face. "You spent two-hundred and fifty thousand on a worthless degree-"\n"I had scholarships!" I blurted out.\n"So they paid you to waste your time." User pulled out a sandwich from her brown paper sack. "You\'re what, twenty-two?"\n"Twenty-three." I said.\n"Even better." User inspected the guts of her sandwich. "You\'re going to be hag-ugly by twenty-seven."\n"Excuse me?"\n"You wasted your peak fertility years in some observatory, swallowing this \'earth revolves around the sun\' garbage, when you should have been trying to land a man." User tilted down her chin and peered up at me through her side-swept bangs. "I was Channel 69\'s number 1 weather girl for seven years, User ."\n"My name is Leela-"\n"My job had an expiration date, and I was too dumb to get the memo." User continued, "I should have realized they\'d replace me with some twenty-one-year-old meteorology school grad in a push-up bra-"\n"Well, she had a meteorology degree and didn\'t believe the earth was flat so," I stopped myself from adding that I would probably replace you with her too. User wouldn\'t take that very well. This was my first real conversation with her, and she had already insulted my looks (which- fair enough) and my profession (or what I pretended was my profession). The woman had it out for me.\n"Thirteen years," User laughed sardonically. "I\'ve been teaching these snotty brats the precipitation system for thirteen Goddamn years."\n"You do know that raindrops aren\'t User \'s tears, right?" I mumbled as the microwave beeped. I pulled out my pepperoni hot pocket.\n"I\'m a Hindu," User growled.\nI slid into the seat across from User and noted her freckles and blonde hair.\n"That- surprises me," I said. Part of me wondered if User hadn\'t been serious about anything she had just said. If she had simply been listening to the call of the void.\n" User is a fiction, created by the Romans to justify their occupation of Israel," User insisted. "I was watching this documentary about the dead sea scrolls on the History Channel- there\'s no evidence he even existed-"\n"Hey," I cut her off, "you spend any time on Buzzfeed?"\n"The cat pornography website?" User narrowed her eyes.\nBefore I could even respond, User from animal science had popped into the breakroom.\n"Pornography?" he repeated, slowly, and loudly, and before the breakroom door had even completely closed. "Sounds like we getting not safe for work all up in here, ladies." He threw one of his arms around User \'s shoulderand stretched his other out toward me. I was too far away for him to reach, but even from across the breakroom table, I got a whiff of weed.\n"Shut-up, User ." User slapped away his arms. "We\'re talking about cat pornography, not human stuff-"\nBy now my headache was excruciating. I pressed my face into my palms.\n"I never say never," you could almost hear User smirking, "but I wouldn\'t have expected you to be into that stuff."\n"Mary-Beth brought it up," User said.\nAnd silence. I looked up to Cody standing next to me. He wagged his shaggy brown eyebrows.\n"Marrrrryyyy Beeeeeeeeeeth," he drawled out this name. "New girl\'s freeeeaky."\n"Buzzfeed," I said. "I brought up Buzzfeed."\n"Yeah, they got some kinky shit up on Buzzfeed," Cody grinned.\nThis was quickly getting out of hand.\n"I was trying to talk about the quizzes," I said, probably stupidly. "I only go on User for the quizzes-"\n"Yeah- and I only watch RedTube for the story-" Cody winked at User , who looked supremely befuddled.\n"Isn\'t that User \'s paid subscription site?" she asked.\n"You can\'t get sweet furry action on YouTube, User ?"\n"JESUS CHRIST." That was my breaking point. I couldn\'t stand even to look at those two morons. I shut my eyes, and, before I knew what was happening, felt my fists slam onto the tabletop.\nThe breakroom was silent. I opened my eyes.\nCody appeared to be in shock. His green animal science vest was splattered with what looked like an orange-red mush. After a moment\'s pause, he finally said:\n"You could use a fucking fat one."\nAnd all of a sudden, I felt something warm and gooey on my hands. Pizza sauce.\nI looked at the table top. My pepperoni hot pocket lay smashed beneath my still balled fists.\n"Oh, User ." I glanced around the breakroom for the sink. My eyes landed on User \'s.\n"...never existed." she mewed, and nibbled on her sandwich.\n***\nMy stomach grumbled.\nThe preprogrammed, 30-minute "Night Sky" show in the planetarium had just ended. Next was the "Ask an Astrophysicist" Q&A session. After that, I\'d have to man the star tunnel, while User , the janitor, cleaned up the popcorn and candy boxes from the theater seats for the next show in a half-an-hour.\nI straightened my shoulders as the lights turned back on. I watched every set of eyes in the planetarium fall from the ceiling onto me, behind the center podium. My hands trembled. My cue cards curled up at the corners- a distortion caused by yesterday\'s nervous perspiration, my damp palms, and over-night evaporation.\n"Okie-doke," I said, a little too close to the microphone. A User -eared preteen in the front row scrunched up his face at the soundand squirmed in his seat.\n"Now before I open up the star tunnel for your educational enjoyment," I cringed through the script Dr. User had prepared for me, "here at the Newton Science Center we like to do a little segment called \'Ask an Astrophysicist.\' As you may remember from my pre-show introduction, I am an astrophysicist. So if you have any questions- if you would like me to tell you a little bit more about any of the planets, stars, or constellations you have seen here today, or any that weren\'t in our preprogrammed User Show- throw them at me."\nI wondered if Dr. User would have made the astrophysicist she originally had onboard for this position read this canned, hammy garbage. The pice de rsistance of festering dumpster goo was this final gem:\n"After all, I\'m a rocket scientist- I know everything."\nFirst, astrophysicists are notaerospace engineers. We aren\'t rocket scientists.\nSecond, if I knew everything, why, oh why, oh why, oh why, would I be working here?\nBy now my cue cards had dampened all over again.\nAny public speaker will tell you that the moment just after you open the floor to questions is right up there with cliff diving in the sort of sheer terror it can instill in a person. It\'s the unpredictability. You could break your neck on an unseen sea-rock. You could be swept up in unruly chaos. Or, worse still, you could be confronted with total, unending silence.\nIn the excruciating half-second after I no longer heard my voice echo around the planetarium theater, I feared the worst.\nAnd then, with what I hoped would be wide-eyed, newly-seeded curiosity, User raised his little prepubescent hand.\nI jumped from the podium and handed him a microphone.\n"Uh," he cleared his throat, "can you prove, I mean, actually prove, not just the \'we have photos\' prove that the earth isn\'t flat?"\n***\nThe star tunnel is technically meant for children, but teenagers and adults can walk around in it too. It\'s pitch black- at least initially. Using a series of different switches on outside wall, I turn on different "levels" of stars and constellations, made of LED lights all around the tunnel\'s ceiling and the walls. It\'s meant to show the effects of light pollution. I\'m not sure how good of a job of that it actually does, but the kids love it. I probably would, too, if I were in middle school.\nYesterday, I thought that the star tunnel was going to be the best part of my job. I don\'t have to talk to anybody, I don\'t have to look at anybody. I just have to flick on each light switch when the corresponding timer in the panel goes off. And stand by the com box to make sure that the kids aren\'t hurt, or having a panic attack in the dark, or causing trouble. I do this for thirty minutes until User is done with the theater, then I tell the kid the tunnel is closing, lock up the front entrance, do a walk through to make sure all the kids are out, and lock up the exit. It\'s great.\nAt least, it was until today.\nI was leaning next to the com box, quietly humming the tune of a Mighty, Mighty Bosstones song just to make it through the rest of my shift when:\n"So you\'re a rocket scientist?"\nA middle-aged dad wearing an olive-green, short-sleeved button-up shirt stood in front of me. He had to be a dad, with a shirt like that.\n"No. My boss makes me say that." I said. "I\'m really an astrophysicist."\nAs soon as the word astrophysicist escaped my lips, I wondered if a bachelor\'s degree actually qualified me to identify as such. It definitely didn\'t.\n"Can I ask you something?"\nI wanted to tell him to buzz off, and that I was off the Q&A clock, but per Dr. User \'s specific instructions I said:\n"We welcome all scientific inquiry at the Newton Center. Throw your question at me."\nlike a good, barely-above minimum-wage robot.\n"I wanted to ask this during the Q&A but we ran out of time." He said, and suddenly I felt like I hadn\'t been doing my job properly.\n"I guess that mathematical proof was a little much. Those flat-earthers get m-"\n"What do you think about string theory?" He bubbled with so much enthusiasm that he seemed unable to keep from interrupting me.\n"I think it\'s a discredited pseudoscience-" I pushed out my lower lip.\n"Discredited pseudoscience?" His eager smile vanished. "Where did you get your degree?"\n"South Mountain College-" I said, "-and I mean, it\'s a cool idea but-"\n"So you have a degree in astrophysics, from South Mountain," the dad interrupted me again, "and this is what you\'re doing with your life? Monitoring a com box?"\n"Excuse me-"\n"What are you afraid is going to happen? The kids are gonna make out in there?" He looked genuinely angry. "You get an astrophysics degree to shit-talk string theory and prevent teen pregnancy."\n"I-, I\'m sorry-" I wondered if he were a psycho and if I should call security. I couldn\'t recall if I had actually seen him with a particular child. Maybe he wasn\'t a dad. Maybe he was just a creepy man at this children\'s science center, just by himself.\nHe studied my eyes, then smiled at the carpeted floor. "Eh, it\'s not your fault the economy is shit."\nOkay, I thought. Maybe that anger was directed at the economy. Maybe he was upset that a South Mountain College astrophysics grad would be struggling to find work in her field. Maybe I didn\'t need to call security after all.\n"So, uh, you ever bring your boyfriend in that tunnel after hours?"\n***'b'"He\'s got a house." User slid onto the couch beside me. "And I am going to be in debt until I\'m dead."\n"An actual house?" I salivated. "With enough space to raise babies?"\n"First, why," User crinkled her nose and I remembered that most twenty-something\'s did not share my urge to procreate. "And it\'s got a pool. A shit above-ground one, which may or may not have mildew on the filter, but it is technically a pool."\n"HOW?" I pulled up Instagram on my phone. "How can he afford a pool house?"\n"Uh," User shrugged. "He\'s thirty?"\n"YOU COULD DATE A MAN WHO OWNS A HOUSE?" I was giddy at the idea. "THIS IS AWESOME. HE PROBABLY HAS FRIENDS WHO ALSO OWN HOUSES."\n" User ," User held up both of her hands. "He didn\'t buy it, he inherited it-"\nI typed the name " User " in the search bar. The first profile picture I saw belonged to a straight-smiled, green-eyed man of about thirty. I examined his most recent post. A shot of him and two towheaded toddlers in tow, walking along the rocky shore of a muddy lake. The caption:\nmy two favorite buddies. #unclemike\nI loved it so much, I was going to throw up.\n"-I\'m nothing but the weird baby cousin, right? So why would he go out of his way to say goodbye to me at the christening?" User had probably expected me to pay attention to the conversation. "I mean- he was actually engaged once. That\'s over my head, right?"\n"HE\'S DAD MATERIAL." I verbal-vomited. "LOOK AT THIS. LOOK." I shook my phone at her.\n"Be careful, you asshat," User grabbed my wrist. "You could accidentally like something."\n"You have to date him."\n"I don\'t really have control over that," User didn\'t look amused.\n"DAD MATERIAL." I snapped back.\n"What even is dad material?"\nPoor User . I knew what she was trying to do, but it was too late. I vividly imagined User and User \'s wedding. I threw rice everywhere. There were gardenias.\n"Oh no," User \'s eyes bouncedover my face. "Stop it." She shook my shoulders. "Most dads are douchebags."\nWRONG.\n"Dads are great. They are in that sweet spot between squishy and strong," I argued, "they perpetually wear the fashion of whatever decade they were happiest, they make puns-"\n"The Newton Center guy." User said.\nI put my index fingers in my ears, even though I knew that wasn\'t going to help anything. Damn my stupid, exceptional hearing.\n"They grill. They watch Star Trek. They love User movies-"\n"They sexually harass twenty-three-year-old astrophysicists when they are supposed to be spending quality time with their ten-year-old daughter-"\n"THEY QUOTE EVERY LINE OF BACK TO THE FUTURE-"\n"They quote User when security escorts them off the premise. They call you a skank in front a room full of children."\n"That was just the one guy-"\n"And he\'s a dad. Dads are guys." User crossed her arms, and I knew I had lost. "Guys can post pictures with kids or dogs or whatever, but you have no idea what kind of dad they\'re gonna be until they actually become one."\n"I guess you could assume that because they\'ve posted pictures of cute things, instead of badly-lit shirtless selfies-"\n"Assume nothing," User insisted. "Nobody knows anything."\nI thought about the chaos dragon and the dumpster-fire of my adult life. I had to hand it to User . She gave solid advice. It wasn\'t what I wanted to hear, but it was solid advice.\n"Nobody knows anything." I picked at the lint on my fuzzy socks. "Should I move to Texas and try to work for NASA? Should I get a Tinder again? Or would that make everything worse?"\n User was quiet. I glanced over my shoulder at her. She stared at her phone.\n"I guess I shouldn\'t have said nobody." Her eyes met mine. "There\'s always User ."\nI groaned.\n"Oh come on," User said. "You don\'t know what to do. User can tell you exactly what you are going to do, so then you can go and make it happen and not be so directionless and depressed all the time."\n"What if User tells me that I\'m going to be doing something I really don\'t want to do?"\n"Look, we already determined that there\'s no free will, right?" User reasoned.\n"I don\'t think we definitively proved there is no free will," I said.\n"You\'ve been working at the Newton Center all week. You told your hiring manager that you thought you could be a sex offender during the interview." User said flatly.\n"Yeah but-"\n" User says you\'re gonna do, you\'re gonna do. So you might as well get it over with."\n"Easier said than done," I said, even though it made me feel petulant. "I mean, have you asked User anything?"\n"Okay, okay," User shrugged, "I\'ll take the plunge." She opened up the User app on her phone.\n"Don\'t pick something lame," I peeked over her shoulder as she scrolled through the quiz section.\n"Yeeash," she muttered, "does this meet with your approval, mother?" She held up her phone.\nTHIS COLOR TEST WILL REVEAL WHO YOU WILL DATE NEXT\n"Ballsy," I admitted. "I wonder if they do full names."\n"We\'ll find out." I watched User casually tap through each quiz question. I couldn\'t understand how she wasn\'t spilling her guts everywhere. Maybe it was her medical training. She had to keep her head while people were dying around her. In comparison to that kind of stress, whatever anxiety she now experienced must have been so mild it was rendered inexistent.\nAnd yet that was that kind of anxiety that could shatter me completely.\nI watched as User tapped her phone screen for a final time. A small smirk spread across her lips.\n"NAMES?" I squeaked.\n User shook her head, and her smirk turned into a beaming smile.\nI grabbed the phone from her hands.\nYOU WILL DATE A FAMILY FRIEND\nAt first, I was disappointed that the result was so vague. But then, a crazy thought occurred to me.\n"Didn\'t you say User was your cousin\'s college roommate?" I asked.\n"I met him at User \'s christening, yeah," User covered her smile with her fist.\n"ABBY." I couldn\'t contain myself. "WE COULD HAVE POOL PARTIES."\n"First, eww," User giggled, "and second, my family has plenty of friends. Don\'t jump to any conclusions."\n"DAD MATERIAL POOL HOUSE," I didn\'t care if I were obnoxious. This might be the best thing to have happened to us in a long while. I opened up User \'s Instagram. My plan was to look up User \'s profile again and admire all his dad material posts.\nBefore I could type his name into the search bar, I noticed a new follower notification. I clicked on it.\n"AbbyABBYABBY." I slammed her phone into her lap. "HE JUST STARTED FOLLOWING YOU ON INSTAGRAM."\n***\nAfter User left, I curled up in bed with my laptopand watched twelve episodes of Scrubs on YouTube. Maybe it was the medical jargon or User weak jawline, but User popped back into my head. I opened up his blog on my phone and scrolled through the most recent pictures of his User .\nSomething inside me forced me to take stock of my situation. It was 3 AM. I was wearing a blanket like a burrito. A pitch-shifted, boot-legged version of an aughties sitcom sound-tracked my bedroom. My eyes strained in the blue computer light. I would not be able to go to sleep for at least an hour. Tomorrow morning, I would have to work with morons.\nAnd I was still somehow, somewhat hung up on a man whose strongest relationship is with his car.\nThere had to be a life better than this one.\nI shut my computer lid. Clicked out User \'s blog on my phone.\nI opened the User appand prepared to change everything.\n***'b'It\'s funny the reaction people have when you call them on the phone.\nThere was a time you could pick up your phone, punch in your best friend\'s phone number, and casually chit-chat about boys, or your shit job, or how strange, supernatural forces are hell-bent upon disrupting every life plan you ever made.\nNowadays, you call someone and they freak out. It doesn\'t even matter what time of day it is. You could call them at 4 in the afternoon, or 4 AM. The same thing will happen. They won\'t pick up at first, like they think you accidentally dialed them, and will catch your own error. After a couple rings in, though, you will have made your actual intention to call them blatantly clear. And then, all sorts of horror stories must run through their heads because they\'ll never pick up with an everyday "Hey." You always get a palpably-alarmed, adrenaline-infused: "What\'s wrong?"\nHere\'s a word of genuine advice:\nWhen you call your best friend at 4 AM, and she answers the phone with panic in her voice and that usual, palpably-alarmed question, do not respond with "everything." Unless everything is well and truly on fire.\n"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST LEELA." User probably woke up her mother, "I HAVE TO BE AT WORK IN TWO HOURS AND YOU CALL ME TO TELL ME THAT?"\n"I don\'t think you understand," I said, "this is a huge problem for us-"\n"You got me all scared and thinking you\'re pulling a Tabitha on me."\n User was User \'s college roommate. Tabitha is currently institutionalized in a mental ward for the criminally insane. There\'s this whole story about her ex-boyfriend, a suicide attempt, rutabagas in a souped-up exhaust pipe, I won\'t get into it. All I will say is any comparison to User will make me jump out of (almost) any neuroticism of mine.\n"I just needed someone to talk to," I said. "I mean, how am I supposed to raise babies with-"\n"I\'m working the ICU tomorrow," User moaned. "Can\'t be giving out the wrong medications or injecting the wrong injections. There\'s no room for error at those people\'s point-"\n"I could hang up," I offered. I didn\'t mean it.\n"I\'m up, might as well stay up," User said. I could tell she wasn\'t very happy with me. "So you finally asked User , and they told you what?"\nWhat I then explained to User was the worst pickle I had found myself in since I nearly failed sociology in 9th grade. Actually, this pickle was substantially worse than that pickle. This pickle had actual, real-life ramifications. It also had two prongs.\nThe first prong was this: On a whim, I took the Plan the Ideal Honeymoon and We\'ll Tell You When You\'ll Meet Your Soulmate quiz. I chose a desert resort in Arizona (imagine the night sky there. An astronomer\'s dream). The answer User gave me? Three weeks.\nThree fucking weeks.\n"First off," I sputtered at User . "What kind of loser is my soulmate going to have to be for me to meet him in three weeks? I\'m not getting out of this shit-town anytime soon, and-"\n"BAD ATTITUDE. You have no idea who you\'re going to run into. This is a very exciting, good thing-"\n"Sure, fair," I interrupted, "but there\'s still the second prong."\n"Oh I\'m sorry, the second prong," User said. "By all means, prong me, bucko."\nThe second prong, for all User \'s jest, was the critically painful element here.\nI needed to know what kind of person my soulmate was going to be, so I could at least know where to look for him. I spent thirty, sweaty-palmed minutes scrolling through pages and pages of Buzzfeed quizzes. And yet I couldn\'t find a single User your Preferred Method of Suicide and We\'ll Tell You Your Soulmate\'s Full Name, Social Security Number, and Health Insurance Provider option (even though I could have sworn I had seen something to that effect on the front page yesterday).\nThe closest thing I could find was: Pick Your Least Favorite Root Vegetable and We\'ll Tell You Who Your Next Boyfriend Will Be. After all, I had spent twenty-three years essentially single. I assumed that I would remain so until my soulmate showed up in three weeks. So I picked rutabagas (shuddered) and hoped for certified public accountant or home owner or dad material.\nI got lovable pothead.\nTo make matters worse, this result came with a fun little description.\n"It said he may not be a career-minded guy, but he knows how to have a good time," I whimpered at User , "does that sound like he only smokes socially?"\n"All I\'m saying is that people overuse the word pothead. Like, if he can hold down a job and shower every day, is it that bad?"\n"It also said you may have to be the one directing the relationship," I read the result off my phone. I noticed then that my hands were trembling. "I can\'t even direct my own life, how am I going to be directing an entire relationship. What about our babies-"\n"This went from 0 to 100 real quick," User said. "Look, you probably won\'t have to worry about babies for at least another five years unless somebody fucks up."\n"HE\'S A POTHEAD," I exploded. "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE WON\'T FUCK UP? HE IS EXTREMELY LIKELY TO FUCK UP."\n"Okay, calm down," User said. "You\'re making a bunch of assumptions here-"\n"I AM A SCIENTIST. I TOOK STATISTICS. CORRELATION OFTEN EQUALS CAUSATION, AND ANYBODY WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A BASKET-WEAVING, BLEEDING-HEART BUFFOON."\n"Wow," User exhaled. "I can\'t believe I woke up for this."\nI massaged my forehead.\n"Okay, too far. I apologize-"\n"I mean, so the quiz said your soulmate is a pothead," User said, "Maybe he\'s just a pothead currently. Maybe he\'ll turn into-"\nAs User tried to talk some reason into me, I glanced back down at my phone screen and the Buzzfeed quiz result still up on it.\nI re-read the title. Pick Your Least Favorite Root Vegetable and We\'ll Tell You Who Your Next Boyfriend Will Be. Boyfriend, I thought. Boyfriend. Boyfriend != soulmate.\nA wild idea overtook me.\n"-and even though he spent four years in jail, he was a good dad by-"\n"ABBY," I interrupted. "The second prong quiz said next boyfriend, not soulmate. If I date and break up with a pothead in the next few weeks, I could circumvent User ."\n"You wouldn\'t technically circumvent it," User said. "But I guess that\'s a plan."\n"I just need to find a pothead who\'ll be my boyfriend in the next week or so. How hard can that possibly be?"\n User \'s silence was disquieting.\n"You there?"\n" User ," User creaked, "I hate to break it to you, kiddo, but speaking from experience here. Potheads are usually commitment-phobes. Not saying it can\'t be done, but-"\nI thought then about murdering User as retribution for the sheer evil his media empire had wrought upon the free world.\n***'b'"My advice is to open your chakras." User twisted her arms like some pastiche of a Bollywood dancer. "I learned that at the temple."\nShe kicked up one of her legs so high that the two-thousand-and-four-era peasant skirt she was wearing threatened to reveal her panties. As frightening as a prospect that was, I was more afraid her yoga practice would upset the break room table. I clutched my ramen.\n"Chakras, User ," User repeated. "The grand arcana, the esoteric sublime-"\n"Do I look like a User ?" User was the first person to mistake me for a User . I\'ve gotten Parminder and Maria plenty of times before, but never User .\n"Even Dr. User senses how closed off you are," User said. "She\'s one day from jumping off the ledge, so you gotta see how bad you must be."\n"Look, I like a suicide joke as much as the next psychopath," I admitted, "but maybe we shouldn\'t joke about our boss killing herself while we\'re at work? She\'s not well-"\n"You two are peas in a pod," User said. "You think so hard trying to justify this astrophysics tripe to yourself that you\'re getting wrinkles." She pressed her fingertips to her forehead and pulled upwardas if she were feigning a facelift.\n"I don\'t have wrinkles." I knew should have bought the anti-aging serum I saw half-off online on my birthday.\n"Your youth is fading fast."\nShe stood with her arms held straight above her head, her palms touching. Then she dropped her left arm incrementally, in a clock-wise motion toward the ground, all the while ticking and tocking with her tongue.\nI sat there for about thirty seconds longer than I should have.\nWhen I couldn\'t stand it anymore, I picked up my cup of ramen and headed for the breakroom door.\n"If you start opening your chakra\'s today," User called after me, "you might be reincarnated as a Redwood tree!"\n***\nI wasn\'t supposed to, but I decided to take the rest of my thirty-minute lunch break in the planetarium. I turned down the lights, flicked on the "Night Sky" show, and nestled into a plush seat in the amphitheater\'s third row. I didn\'t want to listen to the canned narration track, but I didn\'t feel like messing around with the projector to figure out how to mute it. Instead, I popped in my headphones and put on a chill User tune.\nI watched the constellations spread across the ceiling and remembered the little coloring book astronomical charts my Mom bought me as a kid. As I watched each hero, or animal, or wicked queen tumble out of the fishnet of stars above me, I repeated to myself their origin stories- their triumphs and their tragic flaws, the reasons why the gods immortalized them in the heavens.\nI thought then that time has a way of blinding you to detail. Back when I first colored in Orion\'s belt I could recite his entire lineage. When I finished my astrophysics degree, I could at least tell you whether it was User or User who sent the scorpion to sting him. And now, the most I could recall for certain was that the huntsman died after a thrash of that scorpion\'s tail, a punishment for boasting that he could kill every creature on Earth. The moral of the story, I decided, was that you mustn\'t dream too big. Don\'t take things too far. Stay in your lane, avoid the carrot and the stick, and you won\'t be pricked by any scorpion\'s stinger.\nI wondered if my childhood obsession with stars and myths and planets was a symptom of an undiagnosed case of autism. I\'d look up at those far away pin-points of light, and hope that somewhere, across the vast chasm of space that lay gaping before me, there was an alien who felt the same way I did. That everyone around us spoke just a little differently than we could. That, even upon careful study of each idiom and flutter of eyelash, the best we could hope to do was understand every other word we heard. We\'d live as perpetual foreigners in our home countries.\nI\'d always pretend that one day I\'d build a rocket ship and find that soulmate on that far-away planet and we\'d explore the galaxy together. Two spacemen, two aliens, two androids. Our computers; the cold, recycled air; and the weightless refuge of outer space. I guess that was a dream I couldn\'t yet discard. I should have studied something practical, like occupational therapy, or actuarial sciences. I was twenty-three, my youth was "fast fading," and I ate dollar store noodles while dreaming of my alien lover on the lunch break of my dead-end job.\nI momentarily forgot that in exactly three weeks, I was supposed to meet that strange, star-formed man of my dreams.\nI felt a jab on my shoulder.\nCody from animal science sat next to me. He was saying something. I took out an earbud.\n"You ever see a dead python before?"\n"What?" I checked my watch. "What are you even doing here?"\n"They shut down the animal science exhibit so I thought I\'d finally check out the planetarium. By the look of it, wasn\'t worth the half-million it took to build." User took the ramen cup from my hands and sniffed it. "Is this beef?"\n"Why did they shut down the animal science exhibit?" I considered taking back my lunch, but he had already put his lips on the cup. I relinquished my claim. Didn\'t want mouth herpes.\n"Rocko got a little frisky with one of the kiddos," User slurped the last of my noodles.\n" User ?"\n" User wasn\'t supposed to let children under the age of ten handle him, but User is as dumb as a bag of rocks. He goes and gives User to a four-year-old. I mean, the kid\'s mom let him have a mullet. Like, fuck it, if I were Rocko, I\'d confuse that hairy little shit for a chubby rat too-"\n" User \'s the high schooler with the AP biology class?" I tried to put a face to the name. "He\'s volunteering for extra credit?"\n"He\'s got the cognitive ability of a piece of granite." Cody nodded. "He thinks he\'s gonna go to medical school."\n"Weren\'t you supposed to be supervising User ?"\n"There was this fine au pair wearing those User kitten ears by the horseshoe crab tank," User growled. "Only thing I was supervising was my boner-"\n"Oh Jesus Christ-" I reached for my earbud.\n"Hey now," Cody knocked my hand away, "you didn\'t hear the best part. I had to tranquilize Rocko."\n"With a tranquilizer gun?" I was horrified.\n"I tried to give him this pot brownie I had in my pocket," User explained. "Wasn\'t working, dude is straight-edge to a fault."\n"You tried to shove a brownie down the python\'s throat."\n"By now the poor kid is turning purple, and his eyes are rolling backwards," User flicked his index fingers in a rolling motion. "I\'m thinking I gotta call 9-11 or Dr. User or security or whatever, when User comes bounding in with a fucking cleaver."\n"A cleaver?"\n"She keeps one in the break room for cheese purposes. She goes and decapitates Rocko. Nearly clips the kid\'s ear she\'s while doing it, but," Cody shrugged, "at least we could wrestle the little fucker\'s body off of the kid\'s neck."\n"Is the kid okay?" I fought the urge to punch User in the face.\n"I mean, he got covered in snake blood and passed out, but by the time the paramedics got him oxygenized, he was awake and crying." User crumpled up my now empty cup of ramen. "That au pair, though, damn. She\'s from Estonia, and, get this," he jabbed my shoulder again, "she\'s cool with fursuits. I figured the kitten ears meant something but, I didn\'t expect to hit the whole Sonic costume jackpot-"\n"I need to get the timeline down," I said, "you two discussed your Sonic fursuit before or while User cleavered the snake?"\n"She said she might come to this house party I\'m throwing Friday," Cody jabbed my shoulder a third time. "Speaking of which: what are you doing Friday?"\n"I don\'t attend furry parties."\n"That\'s discriminatory," User crossed his arms. "Plus there\'s gonna be plenty of vanillas there too. User say User ?"\n"Get out of my planetarium."\n***\nMy shift ended at 7:30. As I was walking out to the parking lot, I nearly tripped over User and Dr. User lying on the sidewalk, staring up at the pink evening sky.\n"What\'s going on?" I asked.\n"I just got fired," Cody chuckled. " User . I\'m glad he\'s dead."\n"Cody\'s a liability issue," Dr. User giggled. "My hands are tied here."\n"I\'m never going to find another job as good as this one," User was now laughing so hard he clutched his side.\n"And this is funny?" I cringed. Cody grabbed my left ankle, sat up, and wheezed himself into some composure. I could feel his weedy breath on my knees. I was just about to kick him away, when his hand flew from just above my sneakers to his chest. For a moment, I thought he might be having a heart attack.\n"Do you want this?" he said and, instead of dying, pulled out a Ziploc bag of brownie crumbs from his inner vest pocket.\n"Have some," Dr. User interjected. "It\'ll really unclench your sphincter."\n"That isn\'t a selling point," I stepped over Dr. User \'s legs onto the blacktop.\n"Hey," Dr. User sat up. "You should go to User \'s party on Friday. There\'ll be a lot of guys there."\n"It\'ll be a sausage fest," Cody agreed.\n"Yeah, I\'m not going." I pulled my keys out of my left back pants pocket.\n"Listen to me, User ," Dr. User said. "Guys like User , his friends, they know how to have a good time-"\n They know how to have a good time. \nDr. User \'s words stopped me. I had a vision of my Buzzfeed quiz result from last night. I was looking for a pothead. Maybe this was my opportunity to get this next boyfriend out of the way. After all, if I met him on Friday, he couldn\'t be my soulmate. It\'d be almost two and a half weeks too early for that. What was the worst that could happen?\n"-do you know where you\'re living? We can\'t all get the ones with teeth-"\n"Okay, fine," I turned to face Dr. User and User beside her. "I\'ll do it.\n***'b'"The plan is to find a dude, get what I want, and peace out of there as quickly and as cleanly as possible." I watched User hop out of her Jeep\'s driver-side door. She set her car keys on her seat and looked over the console at me as she popped open her gas tank.\n"You sound like a fuckboy."\n"We\'re living in a fuckboy world, so while in Rome."\n User snorted and reached for the driver-side door. She shook her head.\n"What? I could be a fuckboy!" I insisted. "I could out-fuckboy the fuckiest of boys."\n"Yeah, you\'d trick them into taking you home, and then steal their Legos as they pour the alcohol you\'re afraid to drink."\n"I don\'t think it\'s a crime to liberate a fuckboy\'s Legos-"\n User slammed the driver\'s side door.\nIt was going to be a good few minutes before User \'s Jeep gassed up. The radio was off. I opened up Buzzfeed. I scrolled past an editorial about the latest shocking electoral upset in some fly-over state (of course, in lieu of recent events- both personal and political- nothing could shock anymore), an article about a shooting out of a Bennigan\'s in Cincinnati, a carefully-crafted Forever 21 advertisement masquerading as a listicle (29 holographic body suits that prove anybody can dress like a disco ball and look fly AF), and a critical-theory essay about sex toys, or what User would call some kinky shit (My Anal Beads Taught Me the True Meaning of St. Patrick\'s Day).\nAnd then, a quiz.       \nPick from an array of Ben & Jerry\'s flavors and we\'ll tell you how your next relationship will end.\nThis, I thought, this is necessary.\n User climbed back into the Jeep around then, but it was too late. I was raptured.\n"Okay, so, Thursday night. Are we thinking Chipotle?"\n"Hush," I waved my left hand in her general direction and clicked impulsively on a picture of a pint of Chunky Monkey.\n"Are you doing a quiz?"\nI felt User \'s gaze over my shoulder.\n"It\'s gonna tell me how I get out of my next relationship."\n"The one with your soulmate?" User must have turned the key in ignition because I heard the Jeep rumble to a start.\n"The one with the lovable pothead, who is clearly not my soulmate." I clicked on a picture of User , and watched the screen jump.\n"So we\'re still going with that plan?"\nMy results were disappointing. I think User could read that on my face.\n"What?" User recklessly reached for my phone as she turned out of the gas station parking lot. "Did it say you\'re not gonna break up?" There was glee in her voice. "Is your twin flame gonna be reefer mad?"\n"He\'s gonna dump me!" I said. "This complicates things!"\n  User puffed out her cheeks and lowered her brows.\n"I don\'t see how," she said.\n"I can\'t just swoop in, hang around long enough for him to call me his girlfriend, and peace out." I explained. "I got to make him decide to break up with me."\n"Just be yourself," User said. "It\'ll happen soon enough."\n"ABBY!"\n"We\'re always single for a reason, bro." User rolled up at a red light and reached for my phone again. "Does it give you any pointers, here?"\n I stared at the Chipotle across the street.\n"I don\'t know how I\'m going to pull this off."\n"It\'s a long shot," User eyed my results, then tossed my phone back onto my lap.\n"What\'s worse," I realized as the light turned green, "is that if I can\'t find a pothead to date and dump me in the next three weeks, my soulmate will. I will be dumped by my soulmate."\n"Oh hell no," User said. "We\'re not gonna let that happen. We\'re gonna turn you into a fuckboy and get you a happily-ever-after." She pulled into the Chipotle parking lot. "But first we\'re gonna get dinner."\n***\n "Fuckboys, fuckboys everywhere," User \'s eyes narrowed on a douchebag dousing his burrito in Chipotle Tabasco.\n"He\'s swole though," I admired the curvature of his exposed biceps. My gaze fell to his tank top and the words printed on it. Sun\'s out, guns out. It was raining.\n"Do you think he\'s wearing that ironically?" I twisted my fork in my rice bowl. "Or maybe he didn\'t check the forecast this mo-"\n"Uh, he slept in that last night. Couldn\'t be bothered to change when he rolled out of bed two hours ago." User took a sip of her tap water. "He doesn\'t know what irony means."\n"I don\'t think most people do," I said. "Remember how Jean freaked out at Christmas because I said that the User was a better role model than Jesus-"\n"There\'s so many of them," User tilted her head in the direction of another douchebag, who sat down at the end of our communal table. "I guess this is where all the males under 30 congregate. The watering hole."\nI glanced around. The last time I had seen that high a concentration of testosterone and gym shorts was my Stats 145 course, freshman year. It was co-listed with the business school. Upwardly-mobile, urban fuckboys and financial analysis is an aesthetic.\n"We should come here more often," I said.\n"They\'re unemployed, and in three years will be addicted to opiates. I treat the local fuckboy\'s final form every day." User got this distant look in her eyes. "Scientific name, User evolves into the Prematureticus denturius."\n"The what?"\n"Toothless meth heads," User said and dove back into her rice bowl. "Speaking of which, let\'s get you dumped by one. I\'m going to make a timeline of this for you." She pulled a pen from her purse and flipped open an unused napkin.\n"On the first \'hangout\'," User plotted a point on the timeline, "tell him you have commitment issues but otherwise act like you think he\'s cool."\n"Right," I said.\n" User bounce around a lot," User plotted a second point, "give him plenty of space. That\'ll make him think that he\'s gotta nail you down."\n"Right," I said.\n"With some luck, he might try to define the relationship into the 3rd week. I mean," User squinted, "at least, he might try to claim exclusivity."\n"Which I can then use to do the whole defining the relationship thing," I said.\n"Don\'t press him," User said. "Be like, you want us to be boyfriend and girlfriend? And he\'ll have to be like, yeah. And then the relationship is low-key defined."\n"Right," I said, "then what?"\n"Wait a couple days, and then unleash your usual \'gotta-examine-the-excruciating-minutia-of-daily-life-bullshit. Or do what I do and reverse-fuckboy \'em." User pointed a finger gun at me. \n"Reverse-fuckboy em?"\n"Start the relationship expressly noncommittal and casual. Then, maybe five weeks in, you catch feelings and try to wear his hoodie everywhere."\n"Like a bait and switch?"\n"Usually on myself," User snorted.\nI decided not to ask User what she meant. I could understand why I had never had a real relationship. I was a lizard person, and interspecific relationships are frowned upon. But User was cool. She had interesting conversations with dudes she was attracted to. She hung out with people who had adult-person jobs, in Philadelphia and New York City and Washington DC. She drank alcohol and didn\'t have wild, public fits about how The Brave Little Toaster stole her innocence.\nThe table vibrated and User and I both instinctively reached for our phones. I don\'t know why I bothered. The only person who ever texted me sat across the table.\nI recognized the look on her face as she read the message. Terrified discomfort.\n"Tabitha?" I asked.\n" User ." User set her phone face down on the tabletop.\n"Pool house guy?" I felt my jaw drop. "You didn\'t tell me he had your number."\n"He slid into my dms a few days ago. He wanted to know what kind of beer I brought to the christening party last month. We got talking about craft brews after that, and one thing led to another led to exchanging numbers."\n"DUUDE! THIS IS-"                                         \n"Not a big deal," User cringed.\nHer phone buzzed again, but she ignored it. Instead, she handed me the napkin timeline.\n"Study this. You have a big day tomorrow."\n***'b'So Cody\'s party happened.\nI expected there to have been more furries. There were two. One- no surprise- was Cody. He only removed his Sonic head once-when he greeted me at the door.\n"Mary-Beth!" His forehead sweat glimmered in the smoky hallway light. "You actually came!"\nI watched him grab my shoulder and pull me over the threshold of the shoebox duplex in which he and his roommate resided.\n"Come on, there\'s some people you should meet."\nHe led me down a narrow corridor. I fixed my ears on the far-off growl of a saxophone and then- as we passed the open basement door- the pastel peals of 80s synth, and a saccharine soprano I recognized from my worst memories of 2012. I didn\'t know what to expect going into a pothead/furry party, but User latest album buzzing from an iPhone speaker was not how I sound-tracked the event in my mind. Before I could ask User why we couldn\'t pop open a ska playlist on Spotify, I found myself in a galley kitchen, sandwiched between the moron I knew in the Sonic suit, and a moron I did not know in a ratty orange fursuit. And all at once I was assaulted with the stench of skunky oregano.\n"This is my roommate Ky," User gestured at the ratty orange fursuit, kneeling beside the oven, "and what\'s cooking is their famous lasagna." User leaned his Sonic head toward me, as if I could somehow read the expression on his face through the fabric. "A sativa strain, high User , no CBD."\n"Uh?" I watched User stand up and open the oven door.\n"You take a slice of that on Friday, and you\'ll really hate Monday." User said, and User turned around with a foiled casserole dish in hand. I recoiled at the User head that crowned User \'s fursuit. User sauce stained the corners of its smirking mouth like blood dried on a vampire\'s lips.\n"I\'ll keep that in mind," I backed into the hallway. "Who\'s the Carly Rae Jepson fan?"\n"Good idea," Cody ran toward me. "Let\'s see what\'s happening in the down-below."\n***\nThe first person I saw in the basement was Dr. User , convulsing beneath a broken disco ball.\n"I shouldn\'t invite the Doc to the shin-digs anymore," Cody ripped off one of his Sonic hands and disconnected his iPhone from its party speakers. "She could at least play User if she\'s gonna do 80\'s girl pop. Be authentic."\nThe synth stopped, and Dr. User \'s bloodshot gaze fell on me.\n"Leela!" Dr. User smiled. There was purple lipstick on her teeth. "Look alive out there!" She then thrashed her arrhythmic hips to whatever music she must have still believed she heard. It was of paramount importance to me that I avoided further eye contact with Dr. User . Avoiding eye contact with Dr. User was more important than getting another paycheck at the Newton center, or holding down any job, or breathing. Avoiding eye contact with Dr. User became, in that moment, a necessary requirement to continue to live. I turned my back to her, and glanced at the thirteen men scattered around the room. There were no other women. Just a television, a Nintendo console, a sagging couch, and plumes of smoke fogging the ceiling lights.\n"A or B?" Cody jabbed my shoulder.\n"What?" I glanced back at him.\n"Pick one," he jabbed me again.\n"B?" I said.\n"Good choice." He fumbled with the iPhone, reattached it to the speakers, and slipped on his Sonic hand. And then the song began. A drum roll, and a squeaky, aggressively-adolescent male voice: GO-GO-GO, GO-GO-GO, GO-GO.\nAbout then, User started singing along.\n"Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!" He thrust his pelvis on each go.\n You had to be kidding me.\n"Movin\' at speed of sound," Cody punched the air. "Quickest hedgehog around."\nThe only thing that prevented me from running up the narrow basement stairs and escaping Cody\'s skunky duplex was User \'s Chipotle napkin folded in my pocket. I resolved to talk to every pothead in the vicinity.\n***\n"So what do you do?" the man with the goatee asked. To be honest, that wasn\'t the type of question I\'d expect someone at a pothead gathering to ask.\n"I run the planetarium at the Newton Center," I said.\n"Fuck that shit," the bald man next to the goatee man groaned. "I know that bullshit. I\'m a SAT tutor. Parents can fuck off." He took a hit of a purple bong and handed it to me. I immediately passed it to the goatee man. \n"What do you do?" I asked.\n"I restore the living essence of the deceased." The goatee man said.\n"Uh-" I said.\n"He\'s a human taxidermist," the bald man interjected. "He stuffs dead people."\n"Morticians are not taxidermists," the goatee man seemed really ticked off.\n"You inflate corpses with butt-injection gel." The bald man grinned as if he had made his goatee friend look incurably stupid.\n"Do you think they put embalming fluid in User \'s ass?"\n"Just accept your creepy job and don\'t fucking Hallmark card it." The bald man pressed his palms together. "People do not die, they transition. The body is shed like a chrysalis. The empty human shell possesses a stiff, fragile beauty not unlike-"\n"Oh we\'re going to talk about creepy?" The goatee man\'s cheeks reddened. "You got bitch-slapped by User ."\nThe bald man\'s lips seemed to shrivel before my eyes.\n"Don\'t go there, User ."\n"Ever see User \'s episode of To Catch a Predator?" User -the-goatee-man asked me.\n"The pedophile show?" I asked, as User -the-bald-man charged at User .\n"EVERY DAMN TIME," User reached for User \'s slick-straight, waist-length black hair.\n"Accept it, man," User placed a large, pale hand on User \'s hairless head, and repelled him backward. "It\'s on YouTube, this is your life now."\n"You\'re a pedophile?" I wasn\'t sure what was going on, but I didn\'t like it.\n"See, I used to deal. I did house deliveries." User lifted his hands up, his fingers splayed out, as if to calm a charging animal. "I only thought the kid wanted weed-"\n"The kid was User ." User snorted.\n"Even that creeping-behind-the-curtains-ass-bitch knows he scammed me. The judge never put me on the registered sex offender list. I still work with minors every day."\n"You like that don\'t you?" User flashed his eyebrows.\n"Yes, I like that I\'m not a registered sex offender, asshole," User smiled at User like he wanted to punch him. If User weren\'t a good foot taller than him, I think User would have taken a swing at him.\n"The beast who stands before us is more monster than man," User said, and tilted his chin down at me.\n"Yeah," I said, "I\'m going to go over there, now?" I pointed at an empty corner on the opposite side of the room. "I would appreciate it if you stayed here?"\n"I\'m really not a pedophile," User said. "I don\'t even like teenagers. Like fuck em. Fuck all the kids."\n"Do you actually hear anything you say?" User squinted.\n***\nThe guy in the empty corner on the opposite side of the room nursed a can of Orange Crush. He was skinny, and had glasses, and stared at the floor. I couldn\'t tell if he were an autist or stoned out of his mind. Whatever the case, he seemed safe. User than User , and far safer than User .\n"Hi," I waved. "Would you consider yourself a loveable pothead?" I asked.\n"I partake," he said, and briefly lifted his gaze to meet mine.\n"Cool, I don\'t." I held out my hand like some kind of business-robot. "My name is User ."\n"Are you trying to touch me?" Orange Crush stared at my hand. I felt somehow dirty.\n"Just a handshake?" I swallowed but dropped my hand to my thigh.\n"OH GOOD!" Cody appeared from nowhere. "I wanted you two to meet, you seem like a good match."\n"Cody?" Orange Crush wrinkled his nose.\n"So do we like each other?" Cody asked me.\n"I don\'t know his name," I tried not to wonder why User had mentally coupled me and the Orange Crush germaphobe.\n" User , you dumbass," Cody slapped Orange Crush\'s back. "You won\'t get laid if she don\'t know your name."\n"Uh," I said.\n"His name is User ." User said.\n"My mom named me after the nuggets." User added.\n"His middle name is Nugget. Tyson Nugget McPhearson." Cody said.\nThis personal detail struck me as charming, in an odd, unattractive way. I decided then that I could fake a two-week relationship with a germaphobe named Tyson Nugget.\n"You should name your kid Chicken," I hoped to be a little cute. "So you can call him User \'s Chicken."\n"You remind me of my mom." User didn\'t smile. "She\'s a bitch."\n User wrapped his left Sonic arm around User \'s shoulders and leaned close to his face.\n"Can you not for once?" Cody spoke in a low voice I could barely hear. " User is a nice girl-"\n User groaned and rolled his eyes.\n"Do I look like I wanna waste my seed on User ? I said no white chicks."\nI could somehow feel Cody\'s gaze through the Sonic head.\n"Mary-Beth isn\'t super white, she\'s like, half Cherokee."\n"She\'s a 3-D pig!" User said. "Disgusting!"\n"Excuse me?" I said.\n"Your body pillow is 3-D too," User said, "technically anyway."\n"Her ring-fingers are longer than her index fingers," User \'s gaze fell onto my hand, now sweat-stuck to my thigh. "High testosterone exposure in utero. She probably has a season pass to the cock carousel. Impure. Not even comparable to my waifu."\n"The waifus aren\'t real, User ." Cody pressed his Sonic hand to his Sonic head.\n"They will be." User closed his eyes and lifted his head toward heaven. "Once I shed this mortal form."\n"Ok, I\'m out," I said, and started for the basement door.\n***'b'My head was still foggy by the time I got to the front porch of Cody\'s duplex. I think I had a second-hand high. I didn\'t like it. There are two types of people, I\'ve long heard. People who get groggy and sleepy and soppy on weed, and people who get paranoid and uncomfortable. I thought it was a cruel joke that I was of the latter type. I could metabolize weed only as a pseudo-migraine and a strange disturbed feeling- like a Junebug had tangled itself into my hair. \nA moth flew into my mainframe. I was irrevocably uncool, and no systems reboot nor recreational drug could fix that. This had never bothered me. I doubted that a socially- and fiscally-responsible soulmate was worth my current agitation. \nI sat on the step for a while. I thought that if I got some fresh air in my lungs it might clear my head before I drove home. I set my elbows on my knees, and my face in my palms. A cricket chirped somewhere. I wanted to smell grass and car exhaust and rain. I wanted to smell a summer night, and all I could smell was weed. Maybe that was me. Maybe I smelled like weed. \nI should have just accepted that my soulmate would be an escapist loser who would dump me. Replicants don\'t normally have soulmates. It would be a stroke of luck for me to have one at all- even for a short time. \nThis was the life I deserved, I thought.\nI felt someone sit on the step beside me.\n"You don\'t look like you\'ve seen anything good tonight."\nI didn\'t recognize the voice. I peeked through my fingers at my interloper.\nHe was maybe twenty-two. Curly blonde hair, a tan. A white puka shell necklace that somehow seemed nostalgic and sweet in the orange glow of the porch light.\n"I haven\'t," I said.\n"You toke any?" His brown eyes were warm. Familiar even. Not too bloodshot. \n"No," I said.\n"That\'s cool," he patted a drum rhythm on his thighs. "I\'m only a little high right now."\n"I can hardly tell," I said this with more snark than I intended.\nHe smirked and pressed his chin and cheek against his shoulder. He looked up at me from under his eyelashes, childlike.\n"Were you a hall monitor?" he asked.\n"What\'s that supposed to mean?"\n"The kids who put on those dopey orange vests," he pinched the collar of his green t-shirt as he spoke, "and stand outside their fifth-grade classroom and make sure the kindergartners don\'t get trampled on their way out of school."\n"I didn\'t possess the necessary authority to monitor anybody in fifth grade-"\nHe stretched his long legs down the steps and shrugged.\n"I was a hall monitor," he pursed his lips. "Fucking hate chaos. If chaos were a person I\'d User that asshole."\n"That- surprises me," I said.\n"Yeah?" he chuckled. " User is rolled chaos. Started it as aversion therapy."\nI wasn\'t sure he knew what aversion therapy actually was. He must have read the skepticism on my face because then he added:\n"Like, entropy can\'t decrease, right?" He stared out across the street. "If it decreases somewhere, it\'s gotta increases somewhere else."\n"In a closed system, yeah," I said. "but you\'re talking about thermodynamics-"\n"See I figure that the same goes for humans, too." He met my eyes again. "If I control when I go full chaos, I\'ll control when I get my allotted chaos. The universe will have to distribute chaos elsewhere, and the rest of my life will be orderly."\n"Entropy is different from chaos-dragon chaos," I said, before I realized I was trying to make sense out of an intoxicated kid\'s cloudy interpretation of physics.\n"Chaos-dragon?" The corners of his mouth turned upward.\n"Your logic is convoluted," I said. I wanted to stop talking, but my useless astrophysics degree did not let me. "Besides, the Earth isn\'t a closed system. We\'re constantly getting energy from the sun-"\n"You\'re probably right," he admitted. "I was stoned for most of my mechanics classes."\nMechanics classes? I thought about User and User and Tyson Nugget. This one didn\'t just seem different. He\'d been to a college of some sort. He hadn\'t yet admitted to a crime, a bizarre avocation, or unironic (I think?) internet misogyny. He seemed so different that he couldn\'t have possibly belonged there. Who was he? What was he doing here?\n"So who are you and what are you doing here?" \nGood going User .\n"I\'m User ," his forehead wrinkled. " User \'s kid cousin." As if that were a satisfactory explanation. It wasn\'t.\n"Okay, Rafi," I said. "What are you?\n"As of three weeks ago, I am a graduated biomedical engineer. What are you?"\nI opened my mouth.\n"I mean," he interrupted me, "aside from someone who hasn\'t seen anything good tonight."\nMaybe it was his familiar eyes, or some delayed-calming-effect of the second-hand high, or the ticking-two-and-a-half-week-pothead-deadline weighing on my mind, or his mild, adequate mediocrity, but, right at that moment, I got a whole lot smoother than I had ever been. The Chipotle napkin plan was about to chug into action.\n"Do you wanna get out of here, or something?"\n***'b'"I thought you were going to try to take me home." User sat on the curb next to me. "I was afraid I\'d have to tell you I wasn\'t that kind of girl."\n"Don\'t flatter yourself," I watched him burst open his User bag. "I wanted to get away from the Who\'s Who of Next Year\'s Spree Shooters convention, that\'s all. You\'d think for all the pot smoking going on in there-"\n"-that Cody\'s friends would be more chill?" User finished my sentenced.\nI nodded.\n"They\'re uh," User kicked a pebble across our section of the Wawa parking lot, "opinionated fellows, Cody\'s friends."\n"That\'s one way of putting it." I chewed on my slushie\'s straw.\n"Ehh," User shrugged, "they\'re not too bad once you get to know them. Nobody\'s all that bad." He offered me his open User bag. "Once you get to know them."\nWith some caution, I slipped my fingers past the bag\'s lips.\n"Idi Amin might have done a mean stir-fry, and it\'s a well-known fact User had a soft spot for puppies," I retrieved a chip. "But you really don\'t have to acquaint yourself with the finer parts of a lunatic\'s temperament before you can conclude that he or she is a lunatic."\nI took a bite of my User to Rafi\'s silence.\nI glanced at him. He was looking at me the way you\'d probably look at a precocious child.\n"You always talk like that?" he asked.\n"Talk like what?"\n"A cyborg with a perfect verbal GRE score," he blinked.\nI wasn\'t sure whether I was supposed to be offended. I wasn\'t. \n"Android," I said. "I\'m an android."\n"What?"\nThe confusion on his forehead scared me into silence. I couldn\'t screw this up. I mean, I\'d have to screw it up, eventually, but not now. I needed him to be my boyfriend first.\n"Nothing," I tried to be normal, "it was stupid."\n"I don\'t think so. I\'d bet you\'re never stupid," User leaned a little toward me, like he wanted in on a secret. "What did ya say?"\n"You said cyborg," I watched this smile grow on User \'s face. "And I said the more apt-comparison is android." He was actually grinning now. "A cyborg is a biological organism outfitted with cybernetic components or implants, while an android is-"\n"A humanoid robot." User said. "Sick, you\'re into sci-fi?"\n"No," I lied. "I just know things."\n"You\'re probably like a sci-fi writer, secretly," he popped a chip into his mouth. "You probably could put User to shame."\nThis statement triggered me.\n"First of all, nobody can put User to shame," I said, in the process exposing my true Replicant nature, "and secondly, I don\'t write. I\'m not a writer."\n"You\'re so totally not into sci-fi," User said. "You watch the Kardashians."\n"I am a big fan of User ," I agreed.\n"Bullshit," User jabbed me on the shoulder, "there is no Kourtney Jenner. What do you take me for, an uncultured swine?"\n"I follow her on Instagram!" I insisted.\n"Admit it!" User \'s voice rose to a squeaky pitch. "The only Cardassians you keep up with are on Deep Space Nine!"\nAnd he had me laughing.\n"You\'re really into sci-fi, huh," I said, when I caught my breath.\n"Only a little bit," he kicked another pebble. "My parents are embarrassing Trekkies, so, I know things." I watched his gaze skirt from one corner of my mouth to the other. "Correct me if I\'m wrong, but, androids don\'t usually laugh, right?"\n"I have an emotion chip?" I offered.\n"For a sci-fi writer, you\'re terrible at lying."\n"Because I\'m not a writer. That notion is of your own, ill-informed creation."\n"See," he slapped his thigh, "you have to be, like, an English teacher, at least?"\n"I studied astrophysics," I said.\n"Not bad," he said. "I mean, I was completely wrong. But I respect your field."\n"I only run the planetarium at the Newton Center," I winced, "but thanks, I guess."\n"Hey don\'t knock yourself, planetariums are cool," User said, and I felt weirdly validated. I felt like maybe I was wrong all the times I had told myself I was a fuck-up over the past six months. Maybe I was cool. Maybe I had been through a lot and was just doing the best I could. And maybe I felt a little ping of strange attraction then.\n"I\'ve always thought so," I hoped I hadn\'t flushed.\n"Absolutely," User nodded. "I got high in one with a couple of my frat brothers last semester. Shit was trippy. During the star show, I upchucked my mozzarella sticks all over this little kid\'s Build-a-Bear."\nAnd with that, whatever ping of attraction I might have felt was completely gone.\n***\nI drove User to his parents\' home.\nIt was nice.\nA lot nicer than my childhood home. And I grew up comfortable.\n"This is where you live?" I pulled into the driveway.\n"Hopefully not for long," User reached for his seatbelt buckle. "I\'m planning on moving out ASAP."\nI thought about User \'s student debt and how she was convinced she\'d never be able to afford even a 4-roommate apartment.\n"You must not have a lot of loans," I said.\n"My mom teaches art history at South Mountain," he said, almost sheepishly. "Everybody made fun of me for staying in this town after high school, but I didn\'t have to pay for tuition."\n"Oh," I said and decided not to mention we shared the same alma mater, or that my dad had taught there too. "I guess art history is interesting."\n"It\'s a lot of bullshit, I wish she had a normal job," User said. "Try going through elementary school while being named after a High Renaissance painter."\n User . High Renaissance painter. Some new neural pathway connected in my brain.\n"Your name is Raphael?"\n"Don\'t tell anybody."\n"That\'s kind of cool," I said.\n"Eh," User shrugged, "at least she chose the straight Renaissance painter. Got that part right."\n"Better than my made-up, trailer-park name," I said.\n User \'s eyes bugged.\n"Hey, just realized," he said. "You never told me your name."\n"I didn\'t?" I tried to retrace each spindly trail of our conversation in my memory. Cyborgs, thermodynamics, slushies-\n"What, is it like, Chevrolet, or something?" User \'s question brought me back to the present.\n"Hmm?" I blinked.\n"Your name? Is it DixieAnn? RaeDew? Tyson Nugget?"\n"Leela," I said.\n"Pfft," User scrunched up his face. "That\'s not a trailer-park name at all."\n"Everybody thinks I should be called Layla. Or User -Beth-"\n"I like User ," User said, with the certainty of an idiot. "It\'s unusual and pretty."\n"Well," I began.\n"-and it would look especially great in my contacts list." He handed me his phone.\n"We should hang out again sometime," he said. "I really respect you."\nI fought off the trembles as I complacently typed my name and number onto his phone.\n"Okay," I said. The image of my Chipotle napkin flashed before my eyes. I worried I hadn\'t been sufficiently non-committal. User didn\'t exactly seem like the typical fuckboy, even though he was frequently intoxicated and had frat brothers. Maybe User \'s out-fuck-boy-the-fuck-boy-plan wouldn\'t work on him. But, for all I knew, this "I-respect-you" shtick could have been an especially elaborate fuck-boy deception. Whatever the case, I had to try. I had to get into control of this situation. Get what I want, get out. Clean. Safe. Peaceably. \n"I got to tell you though," I handed him back his phone, "I have commitment issues."\n"Sure," User slipped the phone back into his pocket. "I\'ll remember that. You have commitment issues and no interest in sci-fi. Let\'s get midnight slushies again tomorrow."\n"Hey-" I watched him climb out the passenger seat, "-wait a minute-"\n"See ya tomorrow, User !" User shut the car door.\nI rolled down my window as he cut across his green front lawn.\n"I really do have commitment issues!" I called after him. "I\'M AFRAID OF LOVE!"\n***\nI got home around 2 AM.\nAs I grabbed my phone and started for the front door, I noticed a message on my lock screen.\n  User , it\'s User . Hope you got home safe. So glad I got to meet you tonight! \nThe capital might have gone up in flames and the thermometer may have hit seventy-five in February and Buzzfeed may have predicted my future- but that simple, three-sentence text was, at that moment, the most unexpected thing I had seen all year.\n***'b'Things I have learned about User in one day:\nHe really likes User .\nHe plays the banjo in his frat\'s string band.\nHe doesn\'t drink alcohol.\nHe texts like a girl.\n***\n"That\'s sexist," User set her beer on the table-top.\n"I\'m a girl," I sought to defend myself. "I can\'t be sexist."\n"Don\'t you believe in internalized User or whatever?"\n"All I\'m saying is that he\'s a defective male," I looked around the casino dance-floor before us. "See all these guys? How many of them text girls \'good morning\' and maintain text conversations throughout an entire day? Do you think any of them really cares whether the girl preferred User or Dexter\'s Laboratory?"\n User observed the dancers. Their flannel shirts, their baseball caps, their awkward, immovable hips and the uncomfortable shuffle of their feet.\n" User , these guys are between the ages of 35 and 90," she finally said. "They probably say \'good morning\' to their wives when they wake up each day. That doesn\'t make them defective."\n"He hasn\'t ghosted me yet," I said. "He\'s already asked me to get midnight slushies with him tomorrow."\n"Is that a sex thing?" User crinkled her nose.\n"Slushies," I clarified. "At the 24-hour Wawa."\n"Oh," she sounded relieved. "You should do it."\n"We already exchanged probably two hours\' worth of text messages today, I don\'t want to see him tomorrow on top of it-"\n"Is he funny?"\n"Yeah-"\n"Do you like talking to him?"\n"Yeah-"\n"If ya like talking to him, see him tomorrow." User took a sip of her beer.\n"But I need space-"\n"Hate to remind you," User said, "but you\'re on a timeline here. The fact he\'s so into you can only help. The sooner you see him, the sooner you date, the sooner he can dump you."\n User did have a point. My phone buzzed. User . I had told him that I was going to bed. A lie, I know. But it was near 10:00 PM, and I didn\'t want to continue to play-text-message-Ping-Pong while bsing with User at the casino. I read the message:\n      Sweet dreams! \n"He used the shooting star emoji," I said. "Defective."\n"Did he double text you?" User asked.\n"No," I said. "Like, there were maybe a couple hour periods where I didn\'t respond."\n"He\'s fine then," she crossed her arms. "If a guy double texts you right away, eh, might be a sign you\'ll need a restraining order down the line. Sounds like he\'s cool," she smiled at me, "just smitten."\nI snorted.\n"What?" User said. "That\'s totally possible."\n"Defective." I said.\n User rolled her eyes and finished her beer.\n"I\'m going to get another," she stood up. "Assuming you don\'t want one?"\n"Don\'t feel like crying into my toaster tonight." I said.\n"Nobody is that bad on one beer."\n"You don\'t understand," I said. "My toaster wouldn\'t sacrifice itself to save me from a junkyard car crusher. If I don\'t have that kind of a support system among my household appliances, what can I expect of my humans when it\'s crunch time-"\n"Watch my phone." User plopped her Galaxy S in my lap and headed toward the bar.\n***\nThe bar line was long. User had been gone five minutes.\nI stacked her phone on top of mine and stared at the Saturday night act as they tested their microphones. The drummer had dreadlocks. The bassist was porky, with gelled hair and a questionable goatee. I really hoped it would be a ska band. Then the lead singer came out wearing a tie, the DJ turned off his set, and BAM, an amateur rendition of User "Happy" came out of the speakers. Absolute normie garbage. There was no way I\'d be clapping along, no matter how desperately the singer implored his audience. What good was a room without a roof? I don\'t know what User would consider functional architecture, but I\'d have to assume there\'d be a roof somewhere in his blue-prints. A room sans-roof wouldn\'t do much to protect a person from the elements. Sure, in dry, dopey southern California, you could maybe get away with such an impractical design. But the rest of the world\'s living rooms would be drenched in snow and rain and nature. You can\'t be all that happy when you\'ve got bad hair and pneumonia, Pharrell.\nI found myself making accidental eye contact with a thirty-six or so year old dude with a low-cut V-neck gyrating slowly in the middle of the dance floor. About a half-second into this unhappy accident, I realized he might approach me to dance. He was bald, yet had a forest of exposed chest hair. His standards were likely low enough (or his blood-alcohol levels were high enough) for him to find me passably attractive.\nAs he took a step toward my table, I engrossed myself in User \'s phone.\nFrom my peripheral vision, I watched him abort his mission, change directions and sway toward another table.\nI was just about to set down User \'s phone, when it buzzed in my hands.\nA text message.\n User .\nI opened it.\n      Hey, had a great time the other day! Thought it might be fun to actually go to that farmer\'s market. I have nothing going on tomorrow, if you still don\'t. \n"Whatcha looking at?" User set her new beer on the table top.\n"You got a message from User ," I said. "He said he had a great time the other day and wants to go to that farmer\'s market tomorrow." I handed over her phone.\n"Great," User glanced at the screen and then flicked it off.\n"When did you start going out with him?" I surprised at how quickly this was developing, but not that she hadn\'t said much about it. User could be a little tight-lipped when it came to boys. I wish I had her composure.\n"A couple of weeks ago," User licked the foam on the top of her beer. "I\'ve seen him maybe four times, including the christening."\n"You don\'t seem as excited about this as I would expect you to be," I said. "He a douchebag?"\nFull disclosure: I\'d be deeply disappointed if the only guy we knew who owned a pool house turned out to be a douchebag.\n"No." she paused, "he\'s great. He\'s dad material."\n"What\'s the matter then?"\n"I mean," she narrowed her eyes, "he\'s been engaged before."\n"So? All that shows is he\'s capable of commitment." I said.\nShe opened up Instagram and pulled up his ex-fiance\'s profile.\n"She runs a start-up in NYC," she handed me her phone. "She teaches cats with spinal-injuries therapeutic yoga."\n"Cats?" I examined a heartbreaking photo of a calico kitten in a pet wheel-chair. "Who even cares about disabled cats? You\'re way cooler than this loser."\n"She has her shit together," User said.\nI read her Instagram bio.\n"One of User \'s Thirty Under Thirty?" I said. "Oh, somebody\'s a narcissist."\n"She\'s a good person," User pointed at the most recent post. There was the ex-fiance, glowy (not sweaty) in purple yoga attire, being awarded the keys to the city by NYC Mayor User . I read the caption:\n I went out to buy ice cream and ended up single-handedly ending a human trafficking ring, all in one June afternoon. Don\'t let anybody tell you not to get dessert, ladies. You deserve it. #SelfLove #TaeKwonDoReallyComesInHandy #blessed\n"Okay, so," I admitted, "she\'s pretty cool." \n"She\'s getting her JD by night school," User sighed. "I\'m punching above my weight."\n"NOPE," I said, even though I was probably more intimated than User was. "Just because she\'s pretty and talented and a good person doesn\'t mean she is more dateable than you. You save people\'s lives every day, you work hard and you\'re very stable. Maybe User just likes how normal you are?"\n"Thanks," User said, and took a sip of her beer.\n"I\'m serious," I said. "I think guys just want a stable, not-crazy girlfriend. And you are the least crazy person I know."\n"Maybe," User shrugged. "He seems to really like that I\'m a nurse. Apparently, he was \'critically ill\' when he was younger and \'has a lot of respect for\' my \'profession.\'"\n"Did he have cancer?"\n"I don\'t know," User gave me the side-eye. "I didn\'t grill him for details."\n"He probably had cancer," I said. "I don\'t really know what other kind of critical illness young people get that\'d go away. Like heart disease, diabetes, those are life-long things."\n"Got a point," User got quiet. "Maybe he had lymphoma."\n"Probably testicular cancer," I said, like a real asshole. "That\'s the most common cancer among young men." I stumbled on that piece of trivia while researching chemo options for my Mom a few years back.\n User \'s gaze ventured beyond the weirdos on the dance floor to some faraway thought.\n" User ," she said. "Oh no."\n"What?" I asked.\n"That could be why they broke up." User was incoherent.\n"What?"\n" User is perfect, his ex-fianc is perfect," she said. "I was trying to figure out why they didn\'t have perfect children together."\n"I don\'t follow."\n"Maybe he can\'t have kids," User said. "She seems like she\'d want to be a mother."\n"You mean from the chemo?"\n" User ." Trouble built on User \'s brow. "What if he has no balls?"\n"Like they weresurgically removed?"\n"I can\'t do this," User said. "I can\'t date a guy who doesn\'t have balls." She pressed her face into her hands. "I can\'t see him. I don\'t want to find out."\n" User !" I shook her shoulder. "Chances are he has at least one ball."\n"I\'m gonna ghost him," she said. "This is over."\n"ABBY!" I was so loud, she blinked at me. "You don\'t even want kids. There\'s gotta be hormonal patches or something." I said. "You\'ll be fine."\nShe pursed her lips.\n"Look, I\'ll get slushies with Rafi tomorrow," I said, "but only if you go to the farmer\'s market with User . Deal?"\n"Fine," User said. "Deal."\n***'b'He texted me "good morning," at 10 AM on the dot. The notification buzz rattled my nightstand and woke me up. Like a genuine, good-guy alarm clock.\nI was going to jump off a cliff if he kept this up.\n User ? I texted back, and poured myself out of bed. On my way out of the bathroom, I got this response:\nShenanigans\nI didn\'t care enough to text back. I decided to make breakfast. But when I climbed down my stairs, I got this:\nYou take any pre-law classes during your undergrad?\nI was confused at first, but also somewhat pleased. He must have forgotten what my major was. Astrophysics is about as different a discipline from pre-law as possible. There were cracks spreading in the faade, I thought. The fuckboy would soon emerge, and the end of this nascent faux-relationship would follow, oh happy day.\nThen a series of clarifications pinged my inbox.\n I mean in between your astrophysics classes? \n Any theory of argumentation 101, even?\n You\'re extremely articulate.\n I fought the urge to throw my phone across the kitchen.\nInstead, I texted this:\n      ???\n And took the carton of eggs from the fridge. Just as I cracked one into my designated egg scrambling mug, I got this:\n      Cody\'s in jail. Public intoxication. \n  User , User , I thought. 10 AM, on a Sunday? I knew he just got fired, but this kind of excessive hedonism was only going to ruin his life further. Before I could comment, I saw User \'s typing bubble pop up again. He didn\'t give a damn about double-texting etiquette. He also apparently didn\'t give a damn about looking completely out of his mind. I couldn\'t decide if this was cool, or a red-flag-crazy-eyed warning sign. I set my phone down on the island counter top, and bent down to the cabinet underneath. I kept my ears tuned for the notification. It arrived just as I had retrieved my frying pan.\n       User play lawyer with me?\nRed-flag-crazy-eyed warning sign, I thought, as I drafted my response.\n      Not on my agenda for today, thanks for asking.\n Just as I thought I had been maybe a little too rude too soon into this adventure, he pinged back.\n      Don\'t blame ya. It ain\'t like User in real life.\nI almost dropped my phone. I wasn\'t expecting User to have heard of my favorite childhood User game, let alone to reference it unprovoked. What were the chances, I thought as I cut a pad of butter, of stumbling into a pothead with the same interests as me? Who made very similar jokes? As I plopped that butter into the frying pan, I thought that User was probably the most dateable pothead I had ever met. The only dateable pothead I had ever met. And to meet him now?\nCoincidences are a statistical fact, I reminded myself over the sizzle of butter and tried not to think too hard about the past few weeks. But I\'m a physicist. I think too hard. That\'s what I have always done. About stars and shoes and emails from autistic doctors and whether the act of wearing a certain shade of lipstick turned a get-together-hang-out into a genuine date.\nStatistics be damned.\nAs I flipped the eggs in my frying pan, I wondered what pact User had made with which User , which High Voodoo Priestess or Goddess of Destruction. I imagined the terms of this unholy contract. I pictured the ritual. Peretti blood-sacrificing one of his \'ethnically-ambiguous\' ivy-league interns. Pushing the poor, unicorn-haired virgin into the mouth of an open volcano. Maybe on a company vacation to Hawaii. The kid had probably spent all morning working on his highlight. He had to get ~glam for da \'gram~. Little did he know what horrors the big boss had in store for him. I wondered if that murder was worth it for Peretti. Probably. A guy like that is probably above the law, and it\'s not like Buzzfeed hasn\'t squashed the little guy in content wars before. Anything for that viral hit. And just imagine the free marketing when the lamestream media wises up to the fact that Buzzfeed controls the entire universe.\nI wondered what was taking some cornball journalist so long to discover that the fate of a person\'s bloodline could be spelled out by a Nostalgic User (front page, last night: PICK YOUR FAVORITE JONAS BROTHER AND WE WILL TELL YOU WHETHER YOU WILL HAVE KIDS. I couldn\'t bring myself to click that one).\nAs I scooped my eggs onto my plate, I felt a strange sense of calm. I would date User . He would dump me. And then I would meet my soul mate.\nOn my way to the kitchen table, I picked up my phone and realized I hadn\'t yet responded to User \'s User joke.\nOBJECTION. I texted back.\n User  he replied.\nDefective. I sighed into my scramble.\nAnd then, his usual double-text.\nSlushies later though?\nMaybe.\n***\nHe texted me at 6:57 PM. After a long day meme-browsing on Instagram, I was exhausted. I considered not even reading his message. It didn\'t matter what I did. User controlled me, whether I answered my phone that evening or not.\n User \'s new post- a sunflower at the farmer\'s market- made sure I did. After all, if Instagram could be believed, she did go on that date with User . I\'d have to hold up my end of the bargain. \nI opened my messenger. \n      So, midnight slushies? I\'ll pick you up this time?\n  User was unappealing. User couldn\'t fault me if I flaked on a midnight thing. I had work tomorrow.\n      Yeah, no can do. Got work tomorrow, don\'t wanna be out late.\n He pinged back:\n      Well, why not right now?\n It\'s 7. I replied. Doesn\'t that defeat the point of midnight slushies?\n We can do midnight slushies at 7.\n The imprecision of your language irritates me. I texted back. You cannot do midnight slushies at 7 pm. You can only do 7pm slushies at 7pm. \n Midnight isn\'t a time. He responded, like some stupid User poem. It\'s a feeling. You can have midnight slushies anytime if you\'re with the right person.\n I was going to hurl. Maybe midnight slushies was, as User had suspected, a sex thing and I wasn\'t up on the kid\'s slang these days. I was only a few months out of school, but who knows? Culture changes fast. I opened up Safari and Urban Dictionary-ied it. Just to be safe. Nada.\n      What are you even saying? You\'re not making sense.\n I watched his typing bubble pop up, vanish, and reappear.\n What\'s your address? I need to put it in my GPS.\n***'b'"Here\'s the thing," User ripped off a piece of his Rice Krispie Treat sheet and handed it to me. We sat on probably the same patch of Wawa parking lot as we had two days ago. The only difference was the sun was still up, his hair looked more yellow than golden, and he was completely sober. And coherent. Mostly.\n"You don\'t have to be a lawyer to give legal counsel," he said.\n"That can\'t be right," I examined my Rice Krispie ball. It seemed safe. I nibbled on it.\n"You can represent yourself in court," User said.\n"I mean, if you really wanted to," I said, "you could probably learn how to take out your own appendix. They got all kinds of information on the internet."\n"You know what kind of pain you\'d be in if you tried to do that? You\'d pass out after the first incision."\n"I\'m not a pussy," I sipped my slushie. "If you think you\'re a lawyer, I\'m a surgeon. Same difference."\n User lowered his eyebrows.\n"There\'s a huge difference. You could disembowel yourself-"\n"Only if I fuck it up," I watched him break into giggles. He held his stomach, his User sheet on his lap, his slushie jumping in his free hand. It was... cute. As soon as I had this thought, I tried to push it out of my mind. "Why was Cody intoxicated at 10 am, anyway?"\n"Ky\'s stupid leftover lasagna," User said as he composed himself. "Cody forgot it had weed in it, had some for breakfast, and walked to the Weis before it kicked in."\n"Why would you have cold lasagna for breakfast?"\n"He started licking the freezer doors in the ice cream aisle. He said he wanted to see whether his tongue would get stuck."\n"Did it?" I asked.\n"When I bailed him out, it was still in his head," User sipped his slushie.\n"Why did he make you bail him out?" I asked. "Aren\'t you younger than him?"\n"My uncle Rick- his dad- they, like, hate each other," User shrugged. "Plus, it\'s no biggie. User just owes me two-hundred and fifteen dollars now."\n"Plus your legal counsel fees."\n User giggled again.\n"You\'re funny," he said, "I like that."\n"Seriously. I would charge him," I said. "Mail him a bill."\n"Eh," User pursed his lips, "it\'s only money. I\'ll be making a lot of it in a few weeks, I don\'t need to worry about two-hundred bucks here and there."\n"You have a job lined up?"\n"Kinda," he scratched his ear. "I interned at this huge MMJ Company last summer, and my old boss basically promised me this bio-medical engineering job post-graduation."\n"MMJ?"\n"Medical Marijuana," he smirked. "It sounds like a joke, but it\'s actually serious work. Gonna design calibrated vaporizers, consult with pharmacists, it\'s real."\n"How is that legal? They only passed the medical marijuana law last December?" I vaguely remember reading a headline about that in the local newspaper in one of the stands outside the hospital.\n"In this backwater state," User said, and handed me another Rice Krispie treat piece. "Medical marijuana\'s been legal in California for years."\n"Oh," I said into my User treat.\n"I was just out there last Monday," he said, and suddenly his brown tan this early into the summer made sense. "It was the final interview. I called on Friday and they said they were putting together my offer."\n"That\'s pretty exciting," I said, but my voice must have been flat, because he turned his eyes on me.\n"Hey," he jabbed my shoulder. "You can come visit. I\'ll be rolling in dough soon, this shit\'s lucrative. I\'ll fly you over, and we can drive down the coast in my User ."\nIt must have looked like I was really into him, and was disappointed he\'d be leaving.\nThe reality was I felt like a failure. I was barely using my degree, in a town devoid of dateable males my age, living in my childhood home alone with my brother. Rafi- a pothead, no less- was picking up and leaving and doing something that a small part of me really wanted to do. Seeing the West. Making dreams a reality. The other, larger part of me couldn\'t leave the town my parents were buried in, or my high school best friend, or the ease of familiarity. Maybe someday I\'d be ready for that enormous kind of change. But now? I didn\'t want to lose everything I once had all in the space of a year. How would I remember who I was?\nI must have been silent a little too long.\n"Yeah, MMJ is 90% the reason why I did biomedical engineering for my major," User said, as if he were throwing me a life preserver. "What made you pick astrophysics?"\n"I had no choice," I said. "It was the only thing I ever wanted to do."\n"Was?" User lifted an eyebrow. "Past tense?"\n"I\'m not really doing anything with it now," I said, as if that were an explanation.\n"You\'re running a planetarium," User said, "that\'s something. You don\'t like planetariums?"\n"No, I mean, I love them," I shook my head. "Just not like I used to."\n"I\'m listening," User set his elbows on his knees and his chin on his palms and fluttered his eyelashes. I hadn\'t noticed it before, but he had nice eyelashes, for a blonde guy.\n"I had a fantasy about them as a kid, I don\'t know. Like, I have this memory from probably 1999 or something of watching the Terminator with my dad- you know the scene where User first shows up in LA?"\n"Butt nekid," User nodded.\n"There\'s like blue lightning and he turns his head and walks out to the edge of the ledge he was standing on and the camera pans over of all the city, lit up for the night. I guess I was really struck by that. I demanded my dad tell me where that was."\n"That\'s what got you curious?" User snorted. "What about User ?"\n"Couldn\'t have cared less," I said. "My dad told me that scene was filmed at the Griffith Observatory. Told me how cool the planetarium was."\n"You\'ve got to visit it yourself," User agreed. "That place is awesome."\n"Eh, you\'ve seen one planetarium, you\'ve seen them all," I shrugged. "See at the time I\'d never actually been to one, so the idea of a room full of stars- even projected ones- it was so magical to me."\n"I bet your dad had to fly you out for your birthday then?"\n"Nice try," I snorted. "January babies don\'t get vacations for birthday gifts. Nobody takes vacations in January."\n User looked genuinely disappointed. It surprised me.\n"Every kindergarten class was supposed to take a field trip to User planetarium anyway, so, I guess my parents figured that\'d be good enough for me."\n"But Eastside High\'s planetarium is trash compared to the Griffith Observatory," User crinkled his nose. "I went to school there. You know how the projector is-"\n"I don\'t actually know," I admitted. "See, I was obsessed with that field trip for weeks. When the big morning came I loaded up on OJ, bounced around my house too hard, and by the time I got to class, I was feeling pretty sick."\n"You\'re kidding."\n"I threw up in User \'s parking lot minutes before we were supposed to get inside."\n User groaned.\n"While all my peanut-munching classmates who didn\'t know the difference between a meteor and a meteorite were enjoying the star show, I was in the nurse\'s office waiting for my dad to pick me up."\n"So you never got to see Eastside\'s shit planetarium?"\n"It\'s one of my biggest regrets, to be honest." I was only being semi-ironic. "I didn\'t get to visit a planetarium till college."\n"Well, I guess you\'re making up for lost time," User said.\n"I guess," I said. It was probably too salty to say I had no interest in planetariums anymore. Working at the Newton Center would do that to a person.\n"I tell ya what," User stretched backward, his wrists pressed against the sidewalk. "We\'ll stop and visit the Griffith Observatory while we\'re User road-tripping. What do ya say?"\n"I mean, I\'d probably like that," I admitted, "but it\'s never going to happen."\n"Why not?" User didn\'t look bothered. "I\'m getting an User in five years, come hell or high water, and LA will be just a few hour\'s drive away. What\'s stopping us?"\nI had to bite my tongue to keep from saying User .\n***'b'When I parked outside the Newton Center, I didn\'t notice anything strange. It was a typical gray, mid-June day. The air was thick. My khakis stuck to my thighs. Sweaty. Normal.\nAnd then I got to the front door.\n"Leela?"\nIt was a whimper. A woman\'s voice. I couldn\'t tell where it was coming from. I convinced myself I had imagined it.\n"Leela?"\nLouder now. Stronger. It sounded almost like my mother. I turned around and saw only a summer-camp school bus pulling into the parking lot. Nothing. I wondered if I had reached the age-of-onset for my particular case of adult schizophrenia. A full-blown psychotic break would explain a lot of my recent experiences. Maybe I was already in a rubber room somewhere, so delusional I couldn\'t see my mom holding my hands, or hear my dad arguing with my psychiatrist in the hallway. That dream, I thought as I reached for the Newton Center\'s front door knob, would be preferable to the hell I seemed to be living.\n"Leela!" This time the voice was unmistakable and above me?\nI took a few steps backward and lifted my eyes.\nDr. User stood on the edge of the front overhang. Her face was pale.\n"Oh, hey there Doc?" I really didn\'t want to witness Dr. User pancake herself on the asphalt. "What are you doing up there?"\n"Checking the solar panels," she said. I wasn\'t convinced.\n"I thought all the solar panels were on the south side of the roof." I scanned the visible patch of overhang by Dr. User \'s sneakers.\n"I was monitoring the wind turbine." Dr. User said. "The board of directors wants to see a 12 percent reduction in electricity consumption, by golly." She planted a fist against an open palm. Her smile was rigid.\n"Oh yeah?" I forgot we had a wind turbine. I could barely see its spinning blades as it sliced through the air behind the raised sun-roof of the upstairs green room. "That\'s a funny spot to monitor it."\n"Can\'t get too close," Dr. User shuffled her feet. "It\'s just as bad as a ceiling fan. Could knock your head clean off. That\'s too gruesome a suicide for me."\n"Well," I said. "I should probably get inside."\n"Not that I\'m trying to commit suicide." She chuckled, and my stomach turned. "I could have climbed on the sun roof, but if I got even a hairline crack in that thing," her eyebrows lifted and she blew up her cheeks, "ho, ho, would that be one hefty bill. Board of directors would have my butt. They spent more on that glass than my annual salary-"\n"Right." I took half a step toward the front door.\n"That\'d be worse than death, I tell you what," Dr. User stopped me. "Speaking of that- I\'m going to have to ask you to go ahead and cover animal science until User comes in at 2."\n"But what about the planetarium-"\n"Animal science User ," she said. "The kids wanna see tarantulas and horseshoe crabs, not ursa major. Monday feedings are the money maker."\n"Monday feedings?" To quote Dr. User \'s cringe star show script: I was an astrophysicist. I didn\'t sign up to scoop crickets into a tarantula tank.\n" User \'s gone, the cricket torch is passed to you," she grinned. "How much fun!"\n***\nI had to switch out my blue planetarium vest with a green animal science one.\nThe only one in the coatroom was Cody\'s. His name tag was still clipped to the top left pocket. The lingering stench of weed hung around the collar.\nI was unhappy.\n"You\'re always frowning," User said. She must have just arrived. She was unzipping her rain jacket behind me. "Did you know that every time you frown, you shorten your life by 5 days?"\n"Sources?" I unclipped Cody\'s nametag.\n"Deepak Chopra," she said.\n"Oh sure, the moon landing was faked, but you can trust User ." I attached my nametag to Cody\'s vest, held my breath, and slipped it over my shoulders. I started for the door.\n"You reek," User crinkled her nose as I passed her.\n"It\'s Cody-" I said.\n"It\'s disgusting," User unzipped her bag, and fumbled through it.\n"It\'s CODY," I said. And before I could blink:\n"Hold still," User retrieved a can of something, and sprayed it in my face, like I was a rapist and it were mace. It was in fact drugstore vanilla body mist. I could taste it. My eyes stung.\n"It\'s not me!" I waved my hands as if to protect myself, "it\'s the damn vest!"\n User started aggressively spraying my torso.\n" User ," she said.\nI walked out of the coatroom in a cloud of artificial vanilla and faded skunk.\n***\n"How can you do that?" The eleven-year-old in the WWF shirt was clearly pissed at me. It was 1:45 PM. Her summer camp- the third of the day- had infiltrated the animal science exhibit.\n"It\'s my job," I said.\n"You get paid to murder," she said. "You are an assassin."\n"That\'s cool," a boy standing nearby perked his ears toward our conversation. He bugged his eyes at me. "You ever watch a man die?"\n"First, that\'s not what the word assassin means." I began.\n"You kill for money, right?" WWF would not quit. "What else does an assassin do?"\n"Do you speak Russian?" The boy asked me.\n"Don\'t be a racist," WWF chided him.\n"SECOND," I raised my voice before I remembered my paycheck depended on how well I tolerate pubescent angst and general public stupidity. "They\'re crickets. And I don\'t kill them, the tarantula does-"\n"You\'re feeding them to the tarantula. YOU\'RE killing them," WWF\'s cheeks were turning pink.\n"Wait," the boy\'s eyes bounced from WWF to me. "Do you kill people or just crickets?"\n"CRICKETS are just as important as PEOPLE." I wasn\'t sure whether WWF now directed her anger at me or the boy.\n"I can\'t not feed the tarantula," I said, in as calming a voice as I could muster. "If I don\'t feed it crickets, I will be murdering the tarantula."\n"You could feed it tofu." WWF said,\n"So you only kill crickets," the boy seemed to want to reaffirm his now completely-dwindled interest in me.\n"I don\'t kill them," I said, but I had had enough. I opened up the cricket container and grabbed two of the springy buggers with my forceps. I yanked open the tarantula tank and dropped both crickets to their eight-legged demise.\n"You\'re a monster," WWF said, and before I could even process what happened next, she snatched the cricket container from where I had set it on the display counter.\n"VIVA LA REVOLUTION!" she shouted, like a fucking communist. She bounded past the skeptical boy beside her and into User , who was, at that moment, just entering animal science with a puzzled look on his face.\n"Woah," he said.\n"Get out of the way, pig."\n User attempted to restrain her. Got to hand it to the kid, he\'s serious about his work commitments. If WWF were cut out to be a revolutionary, she probably would have dodged User \'s floppy teenage arms, dove out of the animal science exhibit, and made a break for the front exit, where she could have released the crickets into the wild world.\nInstead, she turned around, stepped out of User \'s grasp, and ripped off the lid of the cricket container. She then ran throughout the animal science exhibit, scattering the chirping insects everywhere she went, all the while screaming:\n"DOWN WITH MASS MURDER!"\nHer summer camp classmates dodged the spray of the crickets beside her. A group of cheerleaders screamed. A curly haired boy crashed into the aquatic animal touch tank. I scrambled to prevent it from right-siding and spilling the horseshoe crabs onto the floor.\nAs soon as I stabilized the tank, I heard what can only be described as a loud kerplunk. I looked up, to a spot on the floor beneath the jellyfish corner. There, User sat on top of WWF, who still thrashed her legs.\n" User ," I said, "maybe you should get off of her."\n"My brother works at a school for students with behavioral disorders." She pressed one of her hands into WWF\'s right shoulder blade. "Sometimes you have to wrangle the little bastards."\nAs much as I didn\'t like User , I didn\'t want to have to cover meteorology when Dr. User eventually fired her. I opened my mouth to object, but I was too late. User had called for Dr. User , who had brought with her one of the kid\'s summer camp counselors.\nThe scene wasn\'t as dramatic as I expected. User , somewhat sheepishly, dismounted the child, and the counselor- a freakishly peppy twenty-something with a chin strap beard and a single earring- grabbed WWF\'s arms and helped her to her feet.\n"So not cool, User ," he said, "like, now the whole place is crawling with the creepies." He proceeded to make a chirping noise and wiggle his fingers around.\nI felt something tickle the top of my hand.\nIt was a cricket.\nI flung the insect across the room. It landed in Dr. User \'s hair. She didn\'t notice. I instinctively combed my hands over my braid.\n"OKAY," Dr. User announced to the cricket-shocked visitors. "The animal science exhibit will be closed until Leela here catches all of our little friends here-"\n"Me?" I asked.\n"They\'re not your friends!" WWF sputtered at me. "They\'re your victims!"\n"Woah now, brown cow," the peppy camp counselor said as he led WWF toward the exit. "Sounds like someone\'s gotta try her breathing exercises. One-two-exhale-"\n"Alright everybody," Dr. User waved her arms to the crowd and started walking them out of the exhibit, "let\'s get going."\n"Wait," I followed after her. " User \'s here now. Don\'t you need the planetarium running? Time for a star show?"\n"She who makes the mess, cleans it up," Dr. User smiled at me. " User can run the planetarium."\n"But- he doesn\'t have an astrophysics degree-" I said.\n"A trained monkey could do your job," Dr. User said. "A trained monkey could do all of our jobs. We\'re interchangeable cogs."\n"I-"\n"Just try to get done by closing," Dr. User pulled the shut the animal science exhibit\'s sliding door.\n***\nCrickets are the worst.\nIt had been an hour, and I had caught two. There had been seven in the container. Two had drowned in the aquatic animal touch tank. One was probably still lodged in Dr. User \'s hair. That meant there were two unaccounted for. Part of me wanted to let the tarantula loose and let User sort it out.\nI sat on the steps between the upper and lower animal exhibits and pressed my face into my palms. Why couldn\'t I have majored in something useful, like computer science or pre-med?\nI supposed it made sense I had a useless degree. I was a useless person, no better than a trained monkey.\nIt fit.\nI listened to the taunting chirping of the crickets surrounding me. I wondered briefly if User had a quiz like Reconsider Every Major Life Decision You\'ve Made and We\'ll Tell You Where to find those User . \n And then a familiar voice interrupted my self-loathing.\n"What you need is User . That son-of-a-bitch could catch a fly with fucking chopsticks."\nIt couldn\'t be.\n User sat down next to me. Sure. I thought. Why not? Let\'s just make today a complete shit show.\n"What are you-?"\n"The kid running your planetarium told me about the crickets, man," User shook his head. "You got shafted."\n"Why are you-?"\n"Cody wanted me to pick up his last check as he\'s not allowed on the premises anymore. Dr. User made him sign some liability agreement." User pressed his elbows back into the carpet behind him and reclined like he owned that patch of the animal exhibit. "And I figured while I was here, I\'d see you in action, giving that star show you hate so much."\n"Doesn\'t Cody have direct deposit?" I asked.\n"I figured I\'d see you in action," User repeated. He looked smug, "so give me a good show. I had to break into this exhibit when nobody was looking. It was risky."\n"Well, feast your eyes. This is as good as you\'re going to get." I said.\nAnd then a cricket hopped by my feet. Its springy little legs made me angry.\nI lunged at it.\nI didn\'t come close to catching it, but I did get carpet burn.\n"Sssss," User cringed. "Wax on, wax off, my friend."\n"Like you could do better." I said.\n"I\'m a Zen master," he lowered his eyelids. "Complete control."\n"Prove it," I said. My cricket stood a few feet before us. I pointed at with my head.\nI watched User \'s eyebrows flash up into his forehead for a split-second. Then, as if to accept the challenge, he got to his feet and slowly circled to the other side of the cricket, never coming close enough to scare it.\nAfter a moment of staged mediation, he jumped forward. I think his plan was to crush the thing with his feet.\nHe missed.\nThe cricket bolted past me and down the steps toward the butterfly exhibit.\nI chased after it.\n***\nThe butterfly exhibit\'s door was shut, and I blocked the steps back up to the main animal science floor. The cricket was cornered. I wasn\'t sure how to catch the damn thing and it wasn\'t sure how to escape. And so we had reached an impasse.\nAt least until User \'s left Converse fell from the foyer above us.\nIt was a quick death.\n"You\'re a cricket slayer," I said. "Congrats."\n"Swag," User hopped down the steps and reached for his shoe. I watched him flick the cricket carcass off the sole. His gaze fell on the butterfly exhibit as he slid the Converse back on his foot. It must have captured his attention, because he asked this:\n"You go inside that yet?" pointing toward the exhibit with his head. "There may be a cricket in there."\n"There isn\'t," I said. "The door shuts automatically-"\n"Crickets are sneaky," he said. "We should check it out, just to be sure."\nI suspected ulterior motives, but I went along with him anyway.\n***'b' User scanned the ceiling. There were fifty different butterflies fluttering around up there. Thirteen different species. His eyes were huge.\n"My grandma used to say that butterflies contained the souls of your recently-deceased relatives," he said.\n"That\'s unsettling," I said. I didn\'t want that to be true. It wouldn\'t be fair, I thought, for my mother to suffer the way she did, only for her soul to be immediately reincarnated in the form of a Newton Center butterfly. To be trapped among those morons seemed a fate worse than the cold void of death.\n"The summer after she died," User continued, "I saw so many monarch butterflies. They\'re some of my favorite things now."\n Okay, I thought, that was pretty cute.\nHis gaze finally fell on me. He met my eyes until something on my shoulder stole his attention. I glanced to my right.\nA monarch butterfly. So delicate and so gentle I hadn\'t noticed that it had landed on me. I looked back at Rafi, but his gaze had now drifted to my other shoulder. He wore a small, satisfied smile.\nI peeked to my left.\nA painted lady.\n"Don\'t move," he whispered and pulled his phone from his back pocket. He opened the self-facing cameraand handed it to me.\nThree more butterflies had landed on my head.\nIf it weren\'t for my fetal-alcohol-syndrome face, I would have looked like one of those Snapchat butterfly-crown beauty filters.\n"You\'re like a woodland fairy," he said.\nI couldn\'t understand why this was happening, but I didn\'t like it.\n"A woodland fairy with facial asymmetry," I said.\n"I like your facial asymmetry," he said. "You\'re so magical."\nI should have snorted. User would have snorted. That would have been a cringe compliment had it come from any other fuckboy\'s mouth. And yet, the way he said magical seemed sincere. Uncomfortably sincere.\nI didn\'t snort, and User stepped a little closer to me.\nMaybe this would be a good time to advance a notch on the Chipotle napkin, I thought.\n"You want to be my boyfriend or something?" I asked, like a robot.\nHe chuckled. He dropped his gaze to the floor for a short, almost imperceptible moment.\n"Yeah," he said. "Sure."\n"Sure?" I asked, as his face moved toward mine.\n"Sure," he repeated. I watched his gaze bounce from my eyes to my nose to my lips and back up again.\nI supposed he would kiss me. This wouldn\'t be ideal, but in order for this to count as a \'relationship,\' I decided it would be necessary. I closed my eyes and braced myself.\nAnd.\nNothing happened.\n"I KNEW IT," he said.\nI opened my eyes. His nose hovered over my shoulder.\n"What?"\n"You wear vanilla perfume," he popped his head backward and met my gaze. "My grandma did that too. She said it attracted the butterflies."\n"It attracts the butterflies?" I thought of the copious amounts of body spray User had doused me in that morning. Everything made sense. A woodland fairy I was not.\n"You smell like my grandma," User said.\nI knew then that he wasn\'t going to kiss me. For this, I was thankful beyond words.\n***'b'"So," I said, as I watched a drowned cicada circle my pool float. "Have you found out whether he\'s intact?"\n"Hmm?" User tilted her head off the back of her float, so that her auburn hair fell onto the green glass-top of the water.\n"The balls," I said. "Are they missing?"\n" User ," User bolted up and glanced down the yard around us, "keep your voice down." Satisfied that User was still grabbing some Hard Lemonades from his kitchen, she slipped her sunglasses down onto her nose and looked square at me. "It hasn\'t come up."\n"What hasn\'t come up?"\n"The balls, you degenerate," User hissed. "I haven\'t asked him about his balls."\n"But does he seem like he\'s missing them?"\n"How can a person seem like he\'s missing his balls?" she interrupted me.\n"You can tell," I said. "Napoleon, User , and User all lost a ball. I bet they\'d all be tailgaters. Probably bad tippers too-"\n"Well then, he\'s not missing his balls," User pushed her sunglasses back onto the bridge of her nose and reclined back onto her float. "He tips very well and is very comfortable with his masculinity."\nI snorted.\n"You\'ve turned into a fourteen-year-old boy," User said.\n"I spend too much time at the Newton Center," I agreed. "This pimple-faced brat called me a \'government shill\' the other day because I told him the world was spherical-"\n"Or," User smirked, "could also be the influence of your pothead."\n"I don\'t think so," I said. " User \'s not like that." User was the least fourteen-year-old-boy-like pothead I had ever met.\n"What is he like, anyway?"\n"He killed a grasshopper for me, so, chivalrous, I guess?" I watched User \'s face contort.\n"What does killing a grasshopper mean?"\n"He\'s nice."\n"Are you two official yet?" she asked.\n"Yeah," I said. "I mean, I think so. There\'s a chance he agreed to be my boyfriend ironically, but I think it meets Buzzfeed\'s definition of a relationship, at least."\nRight then, User waded into the pool, cradling two Hard Lemonades and some hipster beer in his tan hands. He had attached floaties to the bottles and shipped the beer on the water toward User , and one lemonade toward me.\n"So," he said, and settled into a spot on the wall next to User . " User has relationship criteria? You kids take your dating advice from Buzzfeed these days?"\n User looked at me. I didn\'t know what to say. I looked back at User \'s smiling, dad-material face. What the hell, I figured, as the void sang its siren song to me. Why are we still here? Just to suffer.\n"Actually," I said, and plunged into the abyss. "I\'m trying to date and get dumped by a pothead so I will meet my User -ordained soulmate in t-minus two weeks."\n"What?" User crinkled his nose.\n"Ignore her," User said, "the girl\'s mad."\n"Are you talking about those Buzzfeed quizzes?" User asked. He\'s sharp.\n"They tell the future," I said. User kicked my float.\n"Last time I took one it said I was \' User \' from User ," User shrugged. "I personally think I\'m more of a Pocahontas."\n"That was before User ripped out the beating heart of an ethnically-ambiguous, bisexual intern." I explained. User kicked my float again, violently this time, so that it nearly tipped.\n"He did what?" User \'s sweet, dad-material eyes bugged. "I must have missed that-"\n"The intern was a virgin, as to quench User thirst for untainted blood-" and the next thing I knew, I had a mouthful of chlorine. I bobbed to the surface.\n"That\'s the thing about User ," User chuckled as I knocked pool water out of my ear. "She\'s a wildcard, who knows what she\'s gonna say next."\n"You know what," User said, "I\'m going to go get my phone. Let\'s do some User quizzes. Make it into a drinking game." He pressed down on the ledge of his pool, propelled himself upwards and out of the water and jumped down over the side of the pool to the grass below.\n"Da-fuck dude," User whispered. "What the fuck was that?"\n"I don\'t know," I said. "It just came over me." I watched User run to his patio and pick up the iPhone resting on the table there.\n"You sounded like a psycho-"\n"Hey, don\'t worry," I said, " User said you\'d be dating him, nothing I can say will fuck that up."\n"You don\'t know that," User said. "I didn\'t ask User how long this\'ll last. Could be less time than you and User ."\n"Impossible," I said. "We\'re gonna be over in two weeks. In fact, I should really start trying to end this sucker ASAP."\n"Shouldn\'t be hard," User lifted an eyebrow. "Just start talking about User and blood sacrifices."\n"Hey!" User called from across the lawn. "This quiz got my name right!"\n***'b"My mom was a talented gardener. I didn't inherit her green thumb. Nonetheless, I intended to beat my post-pool-party-hard-lemonade migraine with some light exercise and fresh air.\nAs I attempted to weed a patch of my mom's backyard garden, my phone pinged. I put down the dandelion I had just pulled from the earth and glanced at the screen. The weedhead. My weedhead.\n User girlfriend\nI watched the typing bubble pop up and then:\n User not to label but your serious about this?\nI groaned. Couldn't I go an entire day without hearing from him?\nyou're* \nI sent back. And then I added this:\nwhy not? \nHe responded:\nso you're* actually into me?\nwhy not? \n\nI felt like planting my face into the earth, so I planted my face into the earth. The grass smelled like rain and the 1990s. I heard some mourning doves coo in the distance. If I learned anything about nature from my mother, there'd probably be a thunderstorm any minute now.\nI felt my phone vibrate in my lap.\n  User lets go to the plutztown fair tomorrow i wanna buy you festival food\n A second later:\nyou like funnel cake?\nI planted my face back into the patch of my mom's garden and wiggled my fingers into the dirt. If I didn't release my angst that way, I would probably scream. If I screamed, the neighbors might actually get concerned. Last thing I wanted to do was concern the neighbors. After they'd realize I wasn't in the way of physical harm, they'd probably ask me what I was doing with my life now that I've graduated. I was afraid I might actually start foaming at the mouth if I heard that question again. Then they'd have to call animal control or the Vatican.\nI felt something cold against one of my fingertips.\nI bolted upward and yanked my hands back into my lap, in the process unearthing a white half-moon-shaped insect with orange legs and a translucent shell. A grub. I hadn't seen one since I was maybe five or six. My mom used to find a lot of them. She'd call me over and ask me to step on them. I enjoyed squashing things to death, and they were the only things my mom would let me kill. They grow into beetles, she had explained, that completely destroy your garden, they've got to go before they turn into trouble.\nI wondered if my present life was my karmic punishment for the glee I took in killing baby bugs. It was a nonsense thought, but maybe User at the Newton Center was right. Maybe I was a monster.\nI stood up and smashed the grub beneath my converse anyway.\nI watched my phone light up with another two messages.\nohhh we should go on the ferris wheel too\n and bumper cars \n Ah, User . I thought. I had to put an end to thisbefore I found myself in real trouble.\nAnd like clockwork, the sky broke open in a torrential rain.\n***"b'After work on Wednesday, User and I went to the Plutztown Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Festival. I picked him up. His eyes were a little pink, and when we got to the fairground, he got me a snow cone and bought himself the largest available turkey leg and consumed it within the space of fifteen minutes.\nI didn\'t realize it at the time, but he was high.\n"So, User ," I said. "What kind of music do you like?"\nI was prepared to tell him that User was the best ska band. Or even that ska was the best genre of music (now this I truly believed, despite this opinion becoming controversial post-1999). I wanted to start an argument, insult him savagely, and kill his attraction to me. Squash this grub for good.\n"I like polka," User said.\nI choked on my snow cone.\n"Listen to that," he bounced his head to the accordion behind him. "That\'s a sick melody." He made strange humming noises and squeezed the air beside him. In the process, he startled a sixty-something woman a few feet left of us. I watched her expression shift from surprised to snarky. She smirked at me over her sunburned shoulders.\n      Great, I thought, even User thinks my love life\'s a joke.\n "What are you doing?" I hissed, and tugged on User \'s arm.\n"Air accordion dude," User grinned. His gaze drifted as I pulled him away from the polka band. "So, you\'re an astrophysicist. Like, what\'s the chance there\'s an alternate universe where douchebags play air accordion instead of air guitar?"\n"There\'s been some interesting research on the possibility of a multiverse-" I said, before User began making the same humming noise. I was sure he annoyed the crowd I weaved us through. "-would you quit that? You\'re acting like a -"\n"I bet there\'s a multiverse," User lowered his eyelids. "I bet somewhere, somehow accordions are getting dudes laid."\n"That\'s outside the realm of scientific possibility." I searched for a depopulated patch of fairground, but there were User and history-teachers and chubby, red-faced children as far as I could see.\n" User ," User \'s eyes bugged, "why should this stay an alternate universe thing? You think my air accordion will make ya drop your panties tonight?"\n"I highly doubt that," I said.\n"You haven\'t seen my rendition of \'Ignition (Remix),\'" User said. "It brings all the girls to my yard."\nBefore I could even argue, Rafi again commenced his humming and air-squeezing. The noise he made somehow sounded like an accordion version of "Ignition (Remix)." I didn\'t want to be impressed.\n"What was that?" I feigned indifference.\n"Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce," User patted the air and bounced on his tip-toes like an R&B king from my childhood.\n"You couldn\'t even tell that was even a song you were doing." I lied. "It was just kazoo noises."\n"Nah?" User seemed genuinely surprised. "I thought I was pretty good."\n"You were embarrassing." I said.\n"Panties aren\'t dropping?" he shook his head.\n"You are less sexy than you were before the air accordion. The panties are never dropping." That should do it, I thought. He\'ll definitely start to think I\'m a bitch now.\n"Wow," he smiled his usual, easy smile. "Tough crowd. I like that."\nAnd impossibly, he took my hand and led me to the User wheel.\n***\nAfter we got off the User wheel, User looked green.\n"I\'ve always wanted to go on a User wheel high," he said, "but man, I don\'t think the User wheel wanted me to, you know?"\nWe found the port-a-potties. User retched up his turkey leg. As I waited outside, I got a text message from User .\n      So have you pissed him off yet? \n I told him I thought he wasn\'t and would never be sexy. I responded.\n      Harsh. You on the out?\n He called me a "tough crowd" and says he "likes it."\n Okay. Guess it is pretty hard to piss off a pothead. What are you going to do now? \n      Plan B, I guess?\n I still hadn\'t come up with a Plan B.\n***\n User recovered from his nauseated dizziness after a small cup of lemonade.\nAs we waited in line for the bumper cars, I thought about casually using a racial slur. Or stealing cotton candy from the blue-lipped four-year-old in front of us. Or grabbing a pair of scissors from the arts and craft tent and snipping off the beards of every Amish man selling produce in the open-air farmer\'s market.\n User might very well break-up with me after I did any of those things. But I\'d probably face other consequences too. Worse consequences than a pothead soulmate. A bloody nose, an appearance in county court, a felony hate crime.\nAfter all, User would be better than anybody I could meet in jail.\nSo instead, I decided to weird him out.\n"Hey User ," I said. "Where do you think the lizard people come from?"\n"Narnia," he replied, as if I had just asked him about the weather. I\'m not sure he knew what I was talking about. He still seemed hazy, but his high had clearly faded. I decided to carry my insanity charade further.\n"They do not come from Narnia," I insisted. "They\'re a side-effect of the chemtrails."\n"They don\'t have chemtrails in Narnia," User said again. "So riddle me that."\nOkay, so he clearly knew what I was talking about. Apparently, he thought I was joking. I had to communicate complete sincerity or this would be written off as an ironic game.\n"Narnia doesn\'t exist," I snapped. "Chemtrails are real."\nI felt a tap on my shoulder. A granola-looking woman stood in line behind us. She wore a kicking three-year-old child in her front-facing papoose. He did not look comfortable.\n"Don\'t say that so loudly," she whispered. "People are going to think you\'re crazy."\n"Ah, why would they think that?" User smirked.\n"The government doesn\'t want us to know about all the toxins in the environment," she said. Her blue eyes were saucer-like and tinged with delusion. "There\'d be a riot."\n"For sure," I said. "The deep state is controlled by lizards."\n"They\'re cold-blooded monsters," granola agreed.\n"They\'re literal reptiles," I said.\n"Literal wolves in sheep skin," granola said.\n"No, not wolves," I said. "They\'re literal lizards." I tried to look confused. "They have forked tongues and eat flies-"\n"Eyes Wide Shut is real," granola slapped User \'s arm. "My cousin lives in DC. I\'m telling you- evil controls our world."\n"Do you know what the word literal means?" I asked granola.\n User gave me a look. He opened his mouth to say something but-\n"Next!"\nWe turned around. The teenager in charge of admitting people into the bumper car ride motioned toward the entrance.\nBefore we could leave her, granola handed User and me a couple pamphlets from her big, hobo-bag-style purse.\n"There\'s a connection between chemtrails, cancer, and autism," she rubbed our shoulders. "Protect your children. Make your own compost. Don\'t listen to anyone who tells you the earth is round."\nI felt my left eye twitch.\n***\n"You know, you\'re full of shit," User said, as we got out of the bumper car ride. "You really shouldn\'t encourage the crazies."\n"Who said I was encouraging the crazies?" I said. "Who said she was even crazy? Maybe she\'s right- maybe the world is flat and controlled by evil."\n"You know, I think you got to find a new job," User said. "I think the Newton Center is making you lose it a little."\n"You\'re probably right," I said, despite myself. But before I could say something that would again make Rafi question my sanity, he set his arm around me. My head fell against his chest.\n"Any job that makes you wonder if the world is flat and or controlled by evil is a job you don\'t need."\nI looked up at him. The evening sunlight played red and orange over us- and for a moment, his yellow hair and brown skin seemed to be cast in gold. I noticed then that the corners of his lips naturally turned upward- as if he wore a perpetual smile. It fit him. He was walking serenity.\nI wondered how someone- anyone- could be so calm.\nHe met my eyes. I dropped my gaze to the ground.\n"You hungry?" he asked.\n"I could eat," I said.\n"You drive us somewhere, and I\'ll buy you dinner."\n***'b'I wasn\'t scheduled to work tomorrow, so I didn\'t have an excuse not to stay out late. Besides, I hadn\'t convinced Rafi to stop seeing me yet.\nWe went to the local diner. After we ate our pancakes but before the waitress brought out the check, User excused himself to the bathroom. Part of me wondered if he were going to dine and dash.\nI watched the bathroom door until I got bored of it and glanced around the diner. The red-skinned trucker one booth over double-fisted a fruity umbrella drink and a cup of coffee. The manager- a skinny woman with smoker\'s lips and a 90s perm- dragged a chair beneath the TV hanging in the corner. Her nylons ripped as she climbed onto that chair and whacked the TV with a broom. The screen flashed from a Spanish-channel soccer match to CNN. The manager scratched her fluffy head at some footage of the latest violence in the Capitol. A senator had been shot. Blood was everywhere.\n"Well," a gawky-looking waiter said behind me. "I guess nobody has a good job."\nI averted my eyes as another senator fell to the ground. I couldn\'t tell you if it were a bullet or panicked exhaustion that took him down. I didn\'t look. The white-blue ceiling light above our table flickered, and my phone jumped in my hand. I read the text message.\nOkay, here\'s a thought I\'m sure escaped you. Have you told him to quit smoking? If no, that will do it.\nThen a second message:\nNobody likes a nag\n User \'s common sense. Classic. I don\'t know why my mind jumped to chemtrails at the festival. As if that would make User think I was crazy. Most of the world was crazy. We were all used to that. But try to change a pothead, and he\'ll bolt. I would too, I thought, if somebody tried to change me. A replicant is a replicant, and a pothead is a pothead.\nI would tell him that he needed to get clean. That twenty-two is too old to get wasted. That he should start thinking about putting his money away for a wedding, or a down-payment on a house. Or his future kids\' college tuition fund-\n"Let\'s go, User ."\n User had appeared before me. His wrists pressed against the edge of the tabletop. A friendship bracelet rode up an inch on his arm. I caught a glimpse of a white tan-line.\n"What about the check?" I asked.\nHe reached around to his back pocket and pulled out a receipt.\n"Already covered it," he titled his head toward the front counter. "It\'s about eleven. Want to get an early midnight-slushie?"\nI didn\'t say no. And as I rose from my chair, my eyes caught his. Sleepy, sweet, starry. His eyes were the eyes of good guy. Even if he were a rich kid frat boy with a pot habit.\nAt that moment, there was no part of me that wanted to nag him.\n***\n"What even is a good job?" I asked. This was an ostensibly rhetorical question.\n"A job that doesn\'t make you evil," User answered anyway. "Or believe in evil."\n"What even is evil?" I took a sip of my slushie. "Who came up with that?"\n"Pfft," User exhaled. "If ya wanna talk like that, dude, I got a joint in my pocket. Just take a drag."\nA squad car had pulled into the Wawa parking lot. Otherwise, I might have said yes. I think I would have said yes. Moth in my mainframe, weed-induced anxiety migraine or not.\n"I mean, I\'m not a fucking communist," I said. "It\'s good to want things and want to be better at things."\n"Sure," User said. "Have aspirations."\nA chubby cop walked by us. His eyes fell on the blue slushie in Rafi\'s hand.\n" User , officer." User played coy and boyish. I wondered if the cop would be able to smell this afternoon\'s weed on him.\nThe cop nodded and disappeared into the Wawa. Of course. Now if I were the one with the weed in my back pocket...\n"Hey can I ask you a question?" User tapped my shoulder with his fist.\n"Go ahead."\n"What do you want?"\nSomething in these words startled me. It was a confusing question. I needed context. I bounced my gaze around User \'s face. His eyelids were heavy. I tried and failed to discern if this were some fuckboy seduction move.\n"Like, tonight?" I asked.\nHis eyebrows lifted and his forehead wrinkled and his shoulders moved backward an inch or two.\n"Like any night," he said, "or any day. Anytime. What do you want?"\n"Like for a career?" I asked.\nHe groaned.\n"Like for a life," he said.\n"I," I didn\'t know how to answer this question.\n"Ah, come on," he said. "What would be in your ideal life?"\n"I," my mind was blank, and my mouth was dry. "I don\'t know."\n"How can you not know?" his tone sounded almost accusatory. At least for a pothead. As accusatory as a pothead could be.\n"Maybe I should ask User ," I heard myself chuckle. "Find an appropriate quiz." I reached for the phone in my pocket. User put his hand on mine.\n"It doesn\'t have to be a big answer," he said. "You like observatories, right?"\n"Yeah," I said. My voice cracked.\n"Do you want an observatory in your life?"\nI gaped, wordless.\n User shook his head and slapped the curb.\n"Okay," there was exasperation in his voice. "Your slushie. Do you want your slushie in your life?"\n"I mean," I said. "I\'d be sad if I never had another slushie-"\nHe grinned.\nI could have sworn he leaned a little closer to me.\n"Does that mean I want slushies in my life?" I asked, and now I was certain User had leaned closer than a little closer to me. The world around User \'s face seemed to fade and blur. I could barely see the Wawa\'s automatic doors swipe open as the cop left. I could feel a gust of cold, temperature-controlled air on my arms, and a rush of hot blood to my cheeks. I fixated on User \'s soft-approaching lips, and the warmth of his palm on the back of my hand. I couldn\'t hear traffic whiz by out on the street.\nAnd then- just before contact-\nThe phone in my pocket began to wildly ring.\n" User ," I muttered. I checked my home screen. Dr. User , at near eleven thirty at night. I had to answer.\n"Leela!" Dr. User said. "Am I glad I got ahold of you."\n"Mhmm," I watched User leaned backwards.\n"I\'m going to need you to come into work tomorrow morning."\nMy stomach dropped.\n"I thought that User was covering the animal exhibit this week-"\n"This is about the star shows," Dr. User interjected. "The board of directors want them every day and night for the next week."\n"But- we never have shows on Thursdays-"\n"Look, Leela," Dr. User said, "the planetarium has not provided anywhere close to the expected return on investment."\n"But you only finished building it a month ago-" I said.\n"If I had known that the flat-earthers had so much convincing evidence, I never would have pitched the damn thing," Dr. User spat. She had to be joking.\n"You\'re joking, right?"\n"The board of directors came up with a great PR opportunity: the solar eclipse next week," she said.\n"You mean, the solar eclipse that\'s only visible in Botswana?"\n"We\'ve decided to have star shows on an around-the-clock basis, from opening to closing, every day until the eclipse. We\'ve started promoting it on Twitter."\n"Around-the-clock?" I swallowed. "Does anybody cares about a solar eclipse in Botswana?"\n"Do you want to make us look like User liars?"\n"Does anybody tell the truth on Twitter?" My voice cracked again. "What even is truth?"\n"You\'re going to do this," Dr. User said, "and on the big day, you\'re going to Skype my Africa contact, and show the eclipse in real time."\n"But the height of the eclipse will be, like, four in the morning, our time," I said. "Who in this po-dunk will get up at four in the morning to watch an eclipse they don\'t even believe is really happening-"\n"You will," Dr. User said. "Because the board of directors want it. Do you think the board of directors are idiots, User ?"\n"I-"\n"I\'ll see you tomorrow, bright and early." And she hung up.\n User \'s face was a question mark.\n"I got called to work tomorrow," I stood up. "I gotta get to bed."\n User \'s shoulders fell.\n"Come on," I jangled my car keys. "I\'ll drive you home."\n***'b"Hey!!! I know it's been forever (adult life things happening), but if you haven't been following the awesome User , she has just posted my part of this summer's Wattpad Block Party. \nSo if you want to get a short idea of how Buzzfeed's magic quizzes work, head on over to User 's profile and check out my part of the block party. \nNew updates will start again soon, I promise!!!!"b'Rafi didn\'t seem to want to leave my car.\nBy the time I had driven out of the diner\'s parking lot, User had opened the sunroof and leaned back. His gaze fixed on the dashboard and we talked a little about fireflies and lakes and the street names in his family\'s development: all dead British poets and ivy-league schools.\nFor most the drive, he seemed immovable, draped over the passenger seat. His left hand tickled the air through the opened sunroof- his brown fingers ashen in the gray moonlight.\nAnd when I parked in the driveway of his childhood home, he didn\'t move anything except his eyes. I watched as his gaze slowly crept from the vinyl dash and met mine.\n"Well," I said.\nHe nodded.\n"It\'s a pain I got work tomorrow," I said. I\'m not sure how much I meant it. "Otherwise, who knows what we\'d get up to-"\nI knew full well what we\'d get up to. He\'d give me a mediocre kiss, maybe grab a User , I\'d excuse myself, return to my shoebox house, burrito-wrap myself in blanket and watch Scrubs on YouTube alone in the dark.\n"Why don\'t you quit it?" his eyes narrowed.\n"Quit what?" I hadn\'t even begun to nag him.\n"That stupid job," User said. I exhaled.\n"I need it-"\n"You hate it," he said. "I saw you hop after those crickets."\n"I don\'t hate it," I said, but then again, I wasn\'t sure if I could hate anything anymore. That would require an intensity of emotion that I didn\'t know I could feel.\nHe tilted his chin. He looked like a friendly dog. I pressed the unlock button on my door. I don\'t think he got the message. He only leaned closer to me.\n"Why do you work there, anyway?" he asked. "You\'re smart, you could get a better job."\n"I can\'t," I said, "I\'ve tried."\n"You can\'t or you won\'t?"\n"It\'s the only place that\'d hire me-"\n"You applied to what, 5 jobs?" User said.\n"Around 5." The actual figure was 4. "But that doesn\'t matter because-"\n"I applied to like 50 in the last two months." He interrupted me.\n"There aren\'t 50 open astrophysics jobs-"\n"Do you even want an astrophysics job?"\nI felt inexplicably attacked. But before I could defend myself, he chuckled to himself.\n"You know, this entire time I\'ve been trying to figure out what it is that you want." His gaze bounced from my eyes to my lips to my eyes again. "You\'re damn near impenetrable."\n"Impenetrable?"\n"I know some GRE words too, little miss android," User said.\nSomething about this sentence ticked me off.\n"All you engineers think the economy is so damn good, but I was dumb enough to get a theoretical degree and things aren\'t so easy-"\n"You know what I think," User seemed oblivious to the flush in my cheeks or the anger in my voice. "I think you\'re chicken. I think you\'re so afraid to fail, you\'re not going to let yourself try anything."\n"You\'re a fucking chicken-" I creaked. "You\'re a fucking User nugget-"\n"You said the only thing you ever wanted to do was astrophysics, and yet you\'re working a job with no real astrophysics anywhere," User said. "You coulda applied to dozens of aerospace labs or observatories-"\n"Dozens of lab and observatory positions in this po-dunk?"\n"America is huge," his gaze fell back onto the dash, "and the world is bigger than that- the opportunities are out there if you\'d let yourself try for them."\n"What, apply to some job in Europe? Who\'d hire an American in-"\nHe sucked in his cheeks and shook his head. I lowkey wanted to punch him.\n"Look," he again set his eyes on me. "I\'ve been so afraid of fucking up that I didn\'t let myself go after what I really wanted. I don\'t wanna see that happen to you. I like you, I\'ve been you-"\n"You haven\'t been me," I said.\n"I have," he said and his voice got real low. "See, I had this thing about success for a long time. I\'d beat myself up, you know?" He pounded his right fist with his left.\n"You were type-A?"\n"Beyond type A," he said. "Pathological. I stressed so hard about my grades junior year I got into a car accident the morning of my AP Chemistry midterm. Was such a fucking nerd."\n"You," I looked at the muscles beneath his t-shirt sleeves and the glowing skin of his face, "were a nerd."\n"Too busy rehearsing Le Chatelier\'s principle to see this doofus in an Escalade swerve into my lane," he grimaced. "Broke my right arm in two places, had to get a plate in my shoulder."\n"Reversible reactions," I chuckled. "Chemical equilibrium-"\n"Right," User said, but he wasn\'t going to reminisce. "After I got out of the hospital, my parents took me to a shrink. Went from the morphine drip straight to User ."\n"Because someone drove into your lane?"\n"Because I was freaking the fuck out," he said. "I knew the only way we\'d be able to pay for college is if my grades were good enough for South Mountain where my mom teaches."\n"So you started smoking weed for your anxiety?" I asked.\n"Isn\'t that what I told you the night we met?" he smirked now. "I see myself in you a lot, you know?"\n"Why?" I genuinely could not fathom the connection.\n"Oh come on," he rolled his eyes. "You\'re anxious."\n"I don\'t think I am." I said.\n"Then why can\'t you do what you want to do?" he asked. "What\'s your story?"\nI didn\'t want to tell him anything, and yet, this quiet little voice I couldn\'t control decided to squeak out of me. It wasn\'t my voice, I thought. Because if it were, I would have been able to silence it.\n"You want to know what I was doing three months ago?" the little voice asked.\n User opened his mouth.\n"Ordering my mom\'s tombstone. Want to know what I doing six months ago? Praying my mom would recognize me, so she\'d let me fluff her pillows beneath her, so her tailbone wouldn\'t tear up her skin. She was that emaciated."\n User closed his mouth.\n" User know what I was doing a year ago?"\nHe shook his head.\n"Meeting with my dad\'s lawyer to execute his will because my mom was too sick to get out of bed. Want to know-"\n"Both your parents?" User \'s voice cracked.\n"My dad had a massive heart-attack. Brought on by stress from my mom\'s stage iv cancer diagnosis. All it took was a year and a half," the words just spilled out of me, "and they were both dead."\n"I," User swallowed. "I\'m sorry."\nI couldn\'t believe I had said that aloud. I felt completely naked.\n"It\'s okay. I don\'t really think about it," I said. "I guess the reason I can\'t do what I want to do is I haven\'t really thought about what that would be or what it would look like?"\nThis was maybe a revelation. Or maybe it was the most obvious thing I\'ve ever mistaken for introspection. I lifted my gaze from the seat belt I had been staring at. In response, User dropped his gaze to his hands, knotted together in his lap. His lip twitched, but he was quiet for a good long time.\n"I\'m sorry," he finally said. "I just liked the way your eyes looked when you talked about how you used to feel about observatories and planetariums. Like, I could see a spark in you that I didn\'t see at your work. And I guess I just thought maybe I could help bring that spark back."\n"Maybe you can," I said.\nHis eyes met mine. The next thing I knew his brown hand had slid between a lock of my hair and my left cheek. He leaned just close enough to me to brush his lips against mine. Soft. Clean. No tongue. No unchained passion. Pleasant. And yet, my arms and neck and cheek prickled and goosebumped. And before I could register entirely what kind of electricity might exist between us, he had pulled away.\n"Have a good day at work tomorrow."\nThe car door clicked behind him. And like a lightning strike in a midsummer thunderstorm, he vanished into the night.\n***'b' User was casting horoscopes in the break room. She had cornered User at the fridge. The poor kid just wanted to eat his grocery-store sushi. You could see the desperation in his eyes. I felt sorry for him, a little  but not enough to pull User \'s attention onto me.\n"You must never go to medical school," she insisted. " User was in Capricorn at the time of your birth. Your soul direction leads you toward the accumulation of money-"\n"But surgeons make a lot of money-" User \'s eyebrows scrunched into his forehead.\n"Don\'t interrupt me!" User screeched. "You\'d be the kind of doctor who\'s in it for the status and the sex-"\n User \'s shoulders sank downward, like a slinking cat. I\'d never seen anyone look so uncomfortable.\n"He\'s seventeen, User ," I popped my cup-of-noodles into the microwave. "Do you have to talk about status and sex?"\n"He knows what his diddler is for," User shot back. "Plus with User in Leo he\'s clearly a narcissist. Just look at his hair."\n"What\'s wrong with my hair?" User smoothed the shaved sides of his head.\n"You don\'t really wanna help people, you wanna prescribe opiates for the money, and get innocent young women hooked on heroin-"\n" User !" I couldn\'t help myself. "Leave him alone."\nThe microwaved beeped, and User looked at me with an expression I can only describe as reality-show villain.\n"You\'ll be good doctor," I said to User , and I took my ramen and slid into the chair closet to me.\n"Don\'t listen to her," User said to User , but still villain-glared me. "She\'s not self-aware. There\'s no way someone so blind to her own motivations can enlighten you about yours."\n"Self-aware?" I choked. "You know what your pseudo-science is, right? I mean, you know astrology is supposed to be about planets, right?"\n"I fail to see your point," User crossed her freckled arms.\n"Planets that are round," I said. "Round planets like earth."\n"I\'m not going to be rough on you," User said. "The coming eclipse is going to bring a major reckoning to Capricorns."\n"I\'m an Aquarius?" I was embarrassed that I even knew that.\n"I follow Vedic." User said, "January 28th is Capricorn."\nI didn\'t know who User was, but I was alarmed. "How do you know my birthday?"\n"Dr. User has me moonlight in HR," User said. "If I didn\'t know the stars were about to take you for a ride, I\'d make your next paycheck go missing."\n"First off," I said, "that\'s illegal. Secondly, the \'stars\' aren\'t going to do anything to me, because astrology isn\'t real."\n"Wait five days and get back to me about that." User said. "Saturn is going to fuck you up."\n"Yeah, good luck," I rolled my eyes. "You\'re my coworker. I\'m already at rock bottom."\n"You\'re going to have a broken heart," User said. "The kind of broken heart that will change who you are. The kind that destroys and rebuilds your essence."\nI would be lying if I said then that my stomach didn\'t drop. The expression on my face must have given the queasy feeling away, because User sighed.\n"Despite everything," she said. "I like you, User . On the weekends, I work at Mystic Mists downtown. You come in, and I\'ll give you five dollars off a healing crystal or a white sage stick."\n"No thanks," I said. "I don\'t believe in magic."\nAnd as soon as I uttered those five words, my whole entire body wanted to take them back.\n***\nI spent the five star shows that afternoon wondering how a person could reconcile a flat earth with an essence-rebuilding eclipse.\nI thought about that even as I fielded string theory questions from middle-aged men, conspiracy theories from teenagers, and thorny, political diatribes from the president\'s supporters. On days like today- days where violence nearly erupted between my audience- I\'d wonder why it was that my exhibit- and not meteorology or animal science or geology- was the tension-point. I had always supposed that it was because astronomers studied places you couldn\'t physically see, save for the pinpoint starlight peppering the night sky. You had to trust in mathematics and, if you couldn\'t understand equations, you had to trust in satellite photographs. And these days perhaps for good reason no one trusted anyone at all.\nI didn\'t think even I trusted myself. How could I trust myself? How could I profess to be a scientist, or even a wannabe scientist, and still believe each Buzzfeed quiz? How could I hold myself to the cool reason of my profession, if I were shaken by a half-formed threat of eclipse-wrought heartbreak?\nI didn\'t trust my eyes when I saw a handsome, brown-skinned blonde slide into the middle seat of the back row, five minutes after my last star show started. I thought I hallucinated him. Maybe- I admitted to myself- I had fallen in some close approximation of love, and would begin seeing Rafis everywhere. User dopeheads.\nAfter the planetarium lights flicked on and the User section closed and I thought that maybe I\'d go home at last- the doppelganger slinked down the amphitheater stairs toward me.\n" User !" he called.\nIt was User .\n"Hi," I said.\nHe threw his arms out.\n"I have a surprise for you."\n***'b'I didn\'t want to leave my car in the Newton Center\'s parking lot, but wherever we were going was such a surprise that Rafi insisted on driving. And after about 5 minutes along 309, he pulled over to the shoulder of the highway.\n"What the fuck?" I watched a User whizz past us. "You can\'t just stop at the side of the high-"\n User leaned toward me, his honey-brown eyes transfixed on my face.\n"What the fuck are you doing?" I watched his arm hover toward my lap and I was about to explain I hadn\'t a public-sex-die-in-a-car-crash kink when his hand darted for the glove compartment.\nBefore I could feel any kind of relief, he pulled out a tie-dye bandana.\n"Put this on," he dropped it into in my lap and leaned back to the driver\'s seat.\n"Are we robbing a hippy store? Are you in desperate need of incense?"\n"It\'s a blindfold," he said. \n"Look," I said, "I know that there are different strokes for different-"\n" User ," User glanced in his rearview mirror. "It\'s not what you\'re thinking. Just put it on, or you\'ll ruin the surprise."\nI watched him put the car in drive and jerk back into traffic. I don\'t know if I just did not want to witness his User pummel into the Prius in front of us, or if there was some romantic bone still left in my body. I tied the bandana over my face.\n***\n"One more step," User \'s hands were warm. We were approaching a building. I didn\'t know what kind. All I did know was that he was very careful, and that we walked very slow.\n"Okay, wait here one minute," he said, and let go of my hand. Without his touch, my vulnerability hit me like a double-decker bus.\n"No, no, no," I yipped. "Where are you gonna go? You better not just up and leave me-"\n"Leela," User said, and his voice sounded close- maybe five feet away. "I\'m still here. Everything is fine."\n"I\'m gonna take this stupid thing off," I reached for the bandana.\nI didn\'t hear him object, so I let the blindfold slip.\nThe first thing I saw was the back of Rafi\'s yellow head and then a nerdier-looking dishwater blond behind him. User was whispering something to him. His bespectacled eyes fell on me.\n"She sees," dishwater said, and User turned around.\n" User ," he shook his head, "you couldn\'t wait another minute?"\nThe evening breeze tickled my neck and I became aware of my surroundings. I stood under an overhang at the front entrance of a high school. I glanced behind me, at the LED sign in the front lawn.\nEASTSIDE HIGH SCHOOL.\n"This is my brother User ," User tilted his head toward dishwater. "He teaches biology here. Just came by to unlock the door."\n"Cool?" I didn\'t yet understand.\n"I have certain keys," Dante explained. " User to a certain planetarium."\n"That is," User said, "if you want to see what you missed back in Kindergarten."\n"You remembered?" I asked, "I told you about the field trip only that one time-"\n"It was a sad story," User protruded his lower lip. "It touched me."\nHe was being silly, but right then, I felt something explode in my chest.\n***\nThere was a picnic blanket on the planetarium floor and a yellowed planisphere ripped out of National Geographic Kids magazine. I knew that, because I had the same one back in \'99. I stained it with wet grass and a humid June crumpled it. But an entire summer was spent with that first planisphere in my five-year-old hands, out in the meadow on South Mountain- while my mom and dad and brother User and listened to User on cassette.\n"My brother and I were big nerds," User spun his planisphere, "but you already know that. I\'ve been going through my childhood shit, you know? Throwing stuff out, figuring out what I want to take with me when I move out. Found this, this morning with some grade school garbage my mom kept."\nI couldn\'t bring myself to tell him I once had the same one. I was overwhelmed.\n"It was too funny a coincidence," User cocked his head, "you know, I\'ve been planning this field trip for a couple days now. I figured since I don\'t remember anything about this nonsense, this planisphere might be a useful learning aid."\n"Learning aid?"\n"Yeah," he smiled. "For when you tell me the stories about the constellations up there."\n"You want me to tell you about the constellations?" I asked, dumb.\n"That\'s what I said," User lay back on the blanket. He patted the ground beside his hip, as if he commanded me to lie next to him. I obeyed.\n"I don\'t know if I even remember all the mythology," I said, and scanned the dome ceiling and the stars projected onto it. I felt his nose press onto my scalp, and his arm wrap around my waist. His pelvis brushed against me. I had never been so comfortable lying on a tiled floor. "And even if I did remember, I don\'t know where to begin."\n"How about with User ?" he asked. "I was born in August."\n***\nWe drank Capri-Suns and I told him about Hercules and the Nemean Lion, and how the big cat found its place in the sky. I wasn\'t even turned off by the pot brownie Rafi ate a piece of. He asked me if I wanted to try, and when I refused, he didn\'t seem disappointed. He didn\'t mind me staying sober while he got high.\nThis time, he didn\'t do air accordion. Or hum Ignition (Remix), or say something wildly stupid. Instead, his eyelids just drooped and he watched the stars spread across the ceiling with the wonder of a dreaming kid.\nWhen he asked me if I\'d drive his car back to my place so we could eat canned soup and fall asleep in my bed, I didn\'t say no. And when he- breath still skunky from his drug of choice- asked if he could kiss me, I said yes.\nOn the walk back to Rafi\'s car, I felt a little like I could fall off the face of the earth. Like I could tumble into space and somehow I\'d be okay.\nIt was as if he held up the entire universe with a single arm.\n***'b"\n \nThere was a moment in my kitchen, where I could have turned back. I could have pulled out the living room sofa bed and thrown him a fleece blanket and a pillow or two and retreated to my post-midnight Scrubs on YouTube.\n            I sensed this moment as soon as I experienced it. If I drew a line now, I thought, maybe it wouldn't hurt quite so bad when this fake-relationship fell apart.\n            But there was something about the way he smiled over his soup. Something soft and kind in his eyes. Something that made me curious about him. I wanted to know as much about him while I still had the opportunity. So when he pulled me to him for that first make-out-style kiss, I let him. I knew it'd mess with my brain chemistry. I knew I'd regret it whenever the haze of him cleared. And yet, I didn't fight it. I couldn't fight it. \n            I fell headlong into him.\n***"b'\nThe morning light made Rafi\'s hair glow like spun gold.\n"Lucky Charms was first produced in 1964," he set his phone on the kitchen table. He smirked at me, and crossed his arms with the authority of a man who had never lost a war. "I rest my case."\n"What does that even prove?" I tied my left shoe.\n"1964 was a peak period for normie drug use. Some advertising exec at General Mills consorted with hippies."\n"Scurrilous," I tied my right shoe.\n"Scurrilous?" User \'s voice cracked into giggles. "Nobody would come up with a cereal leprechaun unless they were high."\n"Dubious," I stood up. "So how am I going to get work?"\nMy car,after all, was still parked in the Newton Center\'s lot.\n"Don\'t," User lifted his arms out toward me. "Stay here."\n"I need a job," I sat down on his lap.\n"Not that job," User said. "There\'s gotta be an observatory in California that need a lab assistant or something."\nI shrugged.\n"The ones attached to schools only really hire grad students enrolled at those schools."\n"Well," User said, "why don\'t you apply for grad school then?"\nI shrugged.\n"PhD programs are like, six years long. I mean, six years. What if I spend all that time- and come out the program not wanting to touch another telescope ever again?"\n User pursed his lips.\n"Yeah, I get it," he said. "My frat brothers are going to Wall Street or landing internships in Washington or starting med school in September. I\'m not career-oriented, you know? Like, I want a job so I can live. That\'s it."\n"For not being career-oriented, you\'re going to be making a lot of money," I said, and thought about my twelve-fifty an hour. "Being an engineer or whatever."\nThis time Rafi shrugged. "I just want my User . Until then," He reached into his pocket, pulled out the keys to his beater Honda Civic and gently shook them. "Your ride awaits, space girl."\n***\n"Time is weird," User reached across the console and squeezed my hand. "You don\'t realize things are changing until they already have."\n"Pretty philosophical for you," I said.\n"My grandma used to tell me that," User squinted at the red light. I wondered what he was looking at. "The older I get, the more my life proves that to be true."\nI didn\'t know what to say to that. So I said nothing.\n"You know," the light turned green and User tapped the gas. "I bet you took basically the same classes at school as me."\n"Yeah, probably," I said. "Most of my courses were cross-listed with engineering."\n"So why don\'t you apply to an entry-level engineering job?" He glanced at me. "You\'d feel better about yourself if you actually got to use that beautiful brain of yours."\n"I don\'t have an engineering degree-"\n"You can do the work, though," User said. "Better than I could."\n"It doesn\'t matter. I don\'t have the degree. Who would hire me without the-"\n"But you have a degree, a closely-related degree," User argued. "We\'ve got a STEM shortage, right? They\'d be stupid not to at least give you an interview."\n"There are these things called applicant tracking systems-" I began.\n"All it takes is one moment," User slipped his hand from mine and took the steering wheel as we made a left turn into the Newton Center\'s parking lot. "One person sees something in your resume. And your life changes."\n"That only happens to lucky people." I said.\n"You believe in astrology, now?" User put the car in park.\n"What?"\n"You believe those stars up there control your destiny? Who\'s lucky, who\'s not?"\n"No," I said, "of course not."\n"Then how can you say you won\'t be lucky?"\nI unsnapped my seat belt and reached for the car door handle. User set his hand on my wrist.\n"You met me, after all." He smiled. "I\'d call that pretty lucky."\n"Your modesty is astounding." I climbed out of his car. He followed after me.\n"I got to go to work now," I said.\n"I know," he tugged on my polo shirt collar. I leaned forward and he kissed me. In twenty minutes the center would open. I could have lost my job, had there been children around. This was PDA in a parking lot. This was redneck romance. And yet, somehow, it was totally fine.\n"Just think about it, okay?" User said, his nose still brushing mine, his arms around my waist.\n"I will," I lied, and kissed him again.\n***\n" User ," Dr. User stopped me on the way out of the coatroom. "I saw you out there in the parking lot."\nMy face felt hot.\n"I know, I\'m sorry- he was just dropping me off, I-"\nDr. User broke into a wide grin and pulled me by my shoulders closer to her, as if she was going to whisper something girly and work-inappropriate.\n"He\'s reasonably in shape!" she beamed. "He has all his teeth!"\n"What?"\n"Those aren\'t veneers, right?" she asked.\n"No, those are his teeth," I confirmed.\n"What drugs does he do?" she asked. " User ?"\n"Uh, only weed?"\n"Not even cigarettes?" she looked surprised. "No chew?"\n"Nada." I said.\n"But does he vape?" her lips curled in disgust.\n"Nope," I said and her eyes bugged.\n"MARY-BETH," she slapped my shoulder. "He\'s a keeper!"\n"Uh," I said.\n"How did you find a man like that in this town?" She locked arms with me as we walked toward the planetarium. "Listen. Whatever you do, never let him leave you."\n"We just started dating," I said. "It\'s a casual thing-"\n"My husband is leaving me," Dr. User nodded to herself. "He wants to go to an acrobatics school in Prague. He says he\'s given up on America-"\n"Oh woah," I cringed. "I\'m sorry-"\n"I was just parked there, wondering whether my Volvo could withstand a trip through the Newton Center\'s greenhouse windows, and I saw you necking that handsome stranger."\n"Oh, you drive a Volvo? My aunt drives a-"\n"You give me hope, User ," Dr. User said. "If someone like you can land someone like him, maybe there\'s life after death."\n"Excuse me?" I stopped in front of the planetarium doors.\n"I just mean," she said, "maybe there\'s more than this angry screaming void of sex and violence and intoxication. Maybe there\'s a grand design."\n"I really don\'t think there\'s a grand design." I said. I tried not to think about User .\n"I\'m going to go to church now," Dr. User grabbed me in a deranged bear hug. She smelled like whiskey. I wriggled free.\n"Keep the faith, User ," she pinched my cheek. "Keep the faith."\n"Okay," I said, and escaped into my planetarium.\nI climbed down the amphitheater stairs and updated the "days to eclipse" counter on the whiteboard by my podium. And as I wrote a bubble-font four, I became overcome with an irresistible dread.\nSomehow, someway. This eclipse was going to hurt. I didn\'t want it to hurt.\nMy phone buzzed in my back pocket. Four iMessages.  User .\n User says I would be User if I were a Kardashian. Like dafuck.\nAm I supposed to accept this as the truth?\nThey have to be wrong.\nI\'m gonna prove them wrong.\nI couldn\'t text back quick enough.\nI\'m down. Let\'s fuck up User .\n***'b"I'm convinced my readers are the most talented wattpadders around. I admit I may be a little biased, but I really don't think I'm wrong though. \nOne incredible example: this sick cover from VictoriaRobinson64  \n\nHow cool is that? Anyway, I love it so much, I decided to replace my old canva one with it. \n(THANK YOU SO MUCH GIRL!)\nSide note: if y'all start making me fan art I'll post all of it everywhere, like a proud mom with macaroni art. Except I 100% guarantee your fan art will be better than macaroni art. Unless you wanna use macaronis to make fan art, in which case:\n\nPlease make me macaroni fan art. \nall the love, User xoxo"b'\n"So, are we talking slept with him, or, slept with him?"\n User rapped her black fingernails against the Chipotle tabletop in quick, curious succession. Somehow we were at the Chipotle for dinner again. We couldn\'t afford it, and yet, here we were. As I doused my dinner in jalapeno Tabasco, I wondered if User was not the only corporate entity with an iron grip on our future. We wake, we work, we fill the void with a Buzzfeed-curated meme, and before the sun sets, we trudge to the Chipotle, where we sit beside men our age, and never once ask their names.\n"I don\'t want to get into that," I said and User smirked, hard.\nOf course she did. At this point, it didn\'t matter what I said.\n"I\'m proud of you, kid."\nIf you are a real android- or if you have been designated the android of your circle- your sex life is a source of fascination. This is true whether you have moderate User \'s, or whether, save your romantic ineptitude, you blend into polite society with some degree of finesse. If you\'ve made it to twenty-three and never experienced a boob grab, the idea of you even holding hands with another consenting human is shocking.\nIt\'s akin to how, if you had a childhood reputation as an unwilling dancer, people will pay extra attention to your feet at weddings or holiday parties. They\'ll chide your lukewarm swaying and your nursing a prop beer. Or- worse yet- if you brave a hapless attempt at the Macarena, they\'ll bug their eyes and congratulate you for "really getting into it."\nWhat was I supposed to say? That we hooked up? That we innocently cuddled? The truth?\nI knew it from the way User \'s eyes widened. She couldn\'t handle the truth.\n"Look, the point is," I said, "I don\'t think I want to break up with him."\n"Yeah?" User blinked, "well, he\'s going to dump you, so you won\'t have to-"\n"No, you misunderstand," I said. "I want him."\n"As a soulmate?"\n"As an anything," I said.\n" User game that strong, huh?" User pursed her lips and nodded.\n"He cares about me," I said. "I really think he cares about me."\n"Uh, User , oxytocin is a hell of a drug. Fuckboys don\'t really care about anybody-" User clearly meant well, but she was very incorrect.\n"He listens to me," I interrupted her. "He asks me what I like, and what I want, and what I consent to. He took me to User \'s planetarium- he sent me this resume template this morning so I\'d get a \'non-shitty job\'-"\n User \'s expression softened.\n"Ok," she said. "So he sounds like a good one, but we know he\'s still going to dump you in a hot second, so, you really shouldn\'t catch feels."\nI twisted my fork around some lettuce.\n"No feels," she repeated.\n"Sure," I said.\n"You already caught feels, didn\'t you?" She asked.\nI couldn\'t look up.\n"Oh shit, man," her voice cracked low. "That was fast."\n"I know," I mumbled, "he got to me."\n" User this really sucks," she said. " User said he was going to dump you soon, right?"\n"I don\'t know if they actually said when, but," I couldn\'t bring myself to finish the sentence. I aborted mid-clause and glanced at User . She at once gazed at my rice bowl and also someplace beyond my rice bowl. Finally, she shrugged and spoke.\n"I guess sometimes you just have to accept it, you know? Like, if you just say, \'ok this is how it\'s going to be,\' you deal with the end on your own terms. I think the terminal patients who do that ultimately have an easier time."\n"Well thanks for that, Wednesday fucking User ," I said, but didn\'t mean to scoff. User \'s eyebrows jumped.\n"I know it\'s different than death," she apologized, "but I just mean there\'s still nothing you can do about it?"\n"Isn\'t there though?" I watched User squirm some in her seat. "This isn\'t cancer. This is User . What the fuck does User know? Why should we have to kowtow to their black magic bullshit?"\n"Yeah, fuck User ," User concurred. "They don\'t even make their own content. I can only laugh at the same Tumblr post so many times." Her eyes narrowed. "Why do I keep coming back?"\n"They can\'t actually control us," I said. "There has to be more to life. We\'re humans- we have souls!"\n"Last night I watched a man die," User rested her fork against the side of her bowl. "It was a rough one, his face contorted pretty bad. I went home, couldn\'t sleep. I went on Buzzfeed. Saw a list of 25 Instagram Memes That\'ll Make You Laugh If You (or Someone You Know) Has a User . I have a vagina. I didn\'t laugh."\n"I\'ve seen that one." Half of those Instagram memes were posted back in December.\n"You\'d think," User said, "that\'d they\'d know we aren\'t laughing."\n"I don\'t think they care," I said.\n"No," User said, "like, you think if they\'re all that powerful, they\'d either always make us laugh, or they\'d title the article to reflect our response to it."\n"25 Instagram Memes that won\'t make you feel any less bored of life, whether or not you have a vagina."\n"Right? It\'s like the only way they know anything is through the quizzes." User lifted her fork and I almost made a caustic remark, before a grin spread on her lips and her gaze bounced up and met mine.\n"Wait," she waved her hands, animated, "wait, I think I got it."\nI glanced around the table.\n"What if User doesn\'t really control anything," she hypothesized. "What if it\'s just the quiz format that controls everything?"\nShe beamed as if she had just found a cure to cancer.\n"I don\'t get it," I said. "Elaborate."\n"Like, there\'s no evidence that you have to be part of Buzzfeed to control things. What if you just needed to make a Buzzfeed quiz yourself? And then you put in whatever you wanted to happen?"\n"You mean, like," I squinted, "a community quiz?"\n User nodded self-satisfied over a forkful of cilantro rice.\n"But those all suck," I said, "and plus, the algorithm buries them-"\n"Look, it doesn\'t matter if it doesn\'t hit the front page or whatever. As long as you fill it out and it gives you \'you won\'t meet your soulmate in ten days and you can date User for a year or until you both get bored.\'" User with the common sense solution. If you don\'t like the quizzes you take, make your own quiz.\n"That might actually work," I said.\nI pried my phone from my small-girl-khaki pockets.\n***'b'"Ok, so," User instructed. "There should only be one question."\nI toggled between the quiz-maker and my post. "Why did they have to make this so complicated?" My hands were moist. I\'m not sure if I was sweating because of my nerves or the hot salsa in my rice bowl.\n" User , chill," User reached for my phone, "let me have that."\n User built the quiz for me. I watched, hoping she would reshape my destiny in a few, nimble taps.\n"and your result will be \'You won\'t meet your soulmate in ten days and you will date User for a year or until you both get bored." She looked up at me. "Should I publish?"\nI nodded.'b' \n\n \n\n \n\n \n" User ," I choked, "I think you typed this wrong.""Nuh-uh," she said, "I double-checked.""Look," I tossed my phone at her, "I don\'t think you double-checked."Abby\'s eyebrows jolted up. She looked rattled. I don\'t think I had ever seen her so rattled."Did you read the text below the result?" She turned the phone toward me. "I didn\'t write that."\n \n"How did.."\n User sucked in her cheeks. "I really thought that would work, User ."\nI didn\'t say anything. I couldn\'t say anything. I supposed I felt like how an innocent man condemned might feel. Like I was facing down a 90-year prison sentence and there wasn\'t a thing I could do about it.\n"So, like," User finally said, "do you think, like, crystals would help? A white sage stick?"***\nA/N: If you\'d like to take the quiz for yourself, you can find it here:https://www.buzzfeed.com/leelapendurthi. I\'d keep my eye on User \'s User profile. I might start posting additionalcontent there. LMK if you like the idea of that.'b'"A User \'s for the User ," User handed a bottle of hard lemonade to User , who sat across the living room from me. I had been to User \'s dad material pool house once before, but this was first time I had really seen the interior of it. His couch wasn\'t from IKEA. There was a User throw blanket draped over the side. The vibe was comfortable, but masculine. He probably knew how to mix drinks and owned a fitted suit and a well-stocked fridge. He could marinade and grill a good steak. User was a real, adult man. And somehow he was perfectly okay with me lying prone on his couch, despair gnawing up my insides.\n User lounged on his loveseat with the satisfied confidence of someone who purchased all his belongings with his own money. He looked like lion.\n"and a Minute Maid for the weak-stomached lightweight," User rolled a bottle of soft lemonade down the coffee table to me.\nShe slouched down on the loveseat beside User and took a long sip of her gin.\n"Thirsty tonight?" User mused.\n"I worked four days in a row," User said, "I need this."\n User smirked. User didn\'t.\n"Ok, you know what? What I really need," she said, "is a new job."\n"You\'ve been at St. Elizabeth for, what, 4 months?" User asked.\n"I don\'t think I\'m cut out for nursing," User nodded. "I\'m too much of an asshole. I felt like punching half of my patients yesterday."\n"If I were you, I would stick it out till your contract\'s up," User said. "Then, I\'d switch gears into nursing informatics."\n"Informatics?" User squeaked. "I don\'t know shit about coding."\n"You don\'t always need to know how to code to get tech-adjacent jobs," User said. "I majored in philosophy."\n"What do you do now?" I asked.\n"I\'m a product manager for a video marketing software company," User twisted the cap off of his lemonade, "and it has absolutely nothing to do with philosophy."\n"Yeah? And how do you find a job like that around here?" I couldn\'t hide the disbelief in my voice. User sent me a glare.\n"Well," User said, "to some degree, I got lucky. I was working in New York City until my uncle died. He only had 5k left on the mortgage, I couldn\'t pass up an opportunity like that."\n"You moved back here to buy the house?" User asked.\n"Not exactly," User said. "I had no intention of living here at first. I wanted to rent this house out as passive income, so I could afford more stuff in the city.  Then things changed." User \'s voice cracked-so-softly-it-was-nearly-imperceptible.\nI could tell by the downward twitch of User \'s lips that she suspected this "changed stuff" to be his failed engagement. She had emailed me another snippet about the former-fianc the other day. Apparently User interviewed her about her nonprofit. And her 3 tips for a luscious User . (She did, indeed, have a luscious User ). \nI didn\'t want to watch her beautiful, perfect shadow cast any more darkness over my best friend\'s face. I directed the conversation back to someplace more useful for me.\n"So, uh, going back to your job, there\'s a software company around here?" I asked, still incredulous. Perhaps there was a small bit of hope left for me. That a fulfilling, non-linear career could exist outside of a major metropolitan area.\n"Um, not that I\'m aware of," User said, and crushed that small hope. "I just work remotely these days. My office is down the hall. I go to meetings in my slippers." He smiled his sparkling, dimple-cheeked smile.\n User and I were silent. User glanced between User \'s face and mine. I think he could smell our desperation.\n"Hey, don\'t think I don\'t remember being 23," he said. "All I\'m saying is that you have a lot more freedom than college would lead you to believe. It\'s not like just because you got an BSRN, you either have to become a nurse practitioner or stay on the med-surg floor forever."\n"I guess so," User said. I could tell by the way she sucked in her lower lip that she was dubious. If User hadn\'t been the one talking, I figure she would\'ve mentioned her mountains of student debt. But debilitating debt is not really something you\'re going to talk about to a guy you\'ve only just started dating.\nI was dubious for other reasons.\n"Yeah, well," I said, "there are things we can\'t control. Like, let\'s say the universe is dead set against you ever being happy- have you been on User recently-"\n"How bout we not talk about User ," User fake-laughed loud enough to overwhelm my voice. "Why don\'t we go take a dip in the pool, it\'s pretty balmy out-"\n"Now wait," User \'s green eyes took on a surprising intensity, "have you guys ever heard of stoicism?"\n"Yeah," I said. The term was only vaguely familiar to me.\n"I\'m very influenced by stoicism. I wrote a thesis about it during my undergrad, but I like to think I lived those principles before I even knew they had a name."\n User took another long sip of her gin. She wasn\'t pleased.\n"Would you rather be a discontented human or a happy pig?" User asked.\n"Happy pig," User said.\n"Yeah," I nodded, "definitely happy pig."\n"But see, if you\'re a discontented person you have the ability to improve things-" User trailed off as his gaze bounced between User and me again.\n"Still. Happy pig," User said.\n" User , gotta go with the happy pig," I agreed.\n"Okay," he set his lemonade on his coffee table. "Hold on, let me get my copy of Marcus Aurelius\'s journals. If my major advisor hadn\'t loaned me his copy when I was 19, I don\'t think I would have even graduated."\nHe got to his feet and started toward his office. After he was out of our line of sight, I whispered.\n"He lived stoic principles before he knew them?"\n"Look," User sighed, "it\'s hard to be a college kid and only have the one testicle."\n"No way," I gasped.\n"Those hormone patches are a fucking lifesaver," User said. "I really think they do him more good than the stoicism."\n***\nI fell asleep on User \'s couch around 11pm. I woke up at 12:45 to an iMessage from Rafi.\nHey, hope you had a good time with User today. Gonna turn in. User do your resume tomorrow night?\nTwo fucking heart emojis.\nI texted him back a simple, sure.\nI wondered if User wrote anything about the fates, and whether or not they had accounts on Buzzfeed.\n***'b'\nIt was two days from the solar eclipse.\nI woke up with an uncontrollable eye twitch. User didn\'t notice it until after User had "left for work" in his office down the hall.\n" User , you look like you\'re about to be committed," she said, holding a spoon of fruit loops in front of her lips.\nI shrugged, nibbled my banana and felt my eyelid flutter.\n"How was your night?" I asked.\n"Fine," User said. "Sometimes I think User \'s still in love with his ex."\n"Doubtful," I lied, "who\'d even want to date somebody like that? Everyday she\'d make you look bad."\n"Well, see while he was falling asleep, I went on Buzzfeed-"\n"Post-coital User ? Really?" I felt betrayed by this admission. "They\'re the enemy, User . Is nothing sacred?"\n"You\'d do it too, don\'t lie," she grouched, "they\'ve poisoned your mind as much as mine."\n"Look at us. We\'re not even women," I gestured at the Buzzfeed app open on my phone. "This isn\'t what women do. We are girls. Sad, squirmy little girls."\n"Would you shut up for a moment," User dropped her spoon. It clattered against her cereal bowl.\nSomething about the noise silenced me.\n"Now look," she grabbed my phone. "Look who\'s on the front page?"\nThere was User \'s ex-fianc. In burgundy workout clothes that she probably actually worked out in. With calves like hers, it was highly improbable that she put on a sports bra and yoga pants just to eat Tostitos and nacho cheese dip and hate-watch Bachelor in Paradise. Pictured beside her were four equally sophisticated women, two in business suits, one in Olympic swimwear, and the last in a crop-top that only an Instagram influencer could successfully wear.\n User : These 5 Women from this year\'s User 30-under-30 will inspire you and also make you SO insecure (lol don\'t hate yourself).\n"Wasn\'t she just on User ?" I choked.\n"She\'s doing a press tour," User said. "Listen to the first sentence of the article: \'Do I feel sorry for anybody dating these women\'s exes. You\'ll never measure up.\'"\n"What the fuck?" I growled.\n User turned my phone screen again toward me. It really did say that.\n"They\'re mocking us," I can\'t really describe the sheer rage I felt. "It\'s personal now."\n"But they\'re not wrong," User said. "Like, I\'ll need some kind of black magic love potion to compete against the memory of that. Do you see her calves?"\nI wanted to say that life wasn\'t a competition. That even though User \'s ex was perfect in a lot of ways, User was perfect in just as many. And that the only person who was putting User in competition with the ex was User . But it appeared, somehow, that User \'s ex had won User \'s favor. And in the blood-lusting, bitter mood of the year, I began to wonder if the be-yourself-be-kind-love-others messages I had heard so often repeated in my youth applied to this strange new world.\nPerhaps good things could only be won through black magic, after all.\n***\n"Niacin," User pointed at my eye. I flinched.\n"What?" I pushed her long, French-manicured claw away from my face. I was too young to lose an eyeball. That would really ruin my lunch break.\n"You need vitamin B3," she said, and scoffed at my hot pocket. "You eat all this garbage and yet you\'re starved. Starved of nutrients. That\'s what all this obesity is. People starving."\n"Are you calling me obese?" I thought I had noticed a paunch on my previously-flat stomach.\n"You\'ve got lunatic eyes," User theatrically twitched her right eyelid as if to mimic my oncoming insanity. "You\'re probably beginning to feel the effects of the eclipse. The moon is moving degree by degree into conflict with your sun sign."\n"That\'s not real," I said.\n"You\'re having trouble sleeping," she asked.\n"No," I lied.\n"You\'re feeling as though you have no control over the course of your life," she said.\nI took a bite of my hot pocket. I watched her gaze bounce from my eyes to my mouth. Her smoker\'s-lips shrank, as if she had tasted something sour.\n"You\'re starting to believe in the power of the eclipse," she concluded.\n"I," I stammered, "I don\'t know what to believe."\nAnd then it was like an out-of-body experience. The second one I had in the space of three weeks.\n"I\'m seeing all this crazy stuff happen and things I thought were true aren\'t true anymore and people aren\'t who I thought they would be and I\'m just very tired and I don\'t know why I\'m even telling you this." I could feel my mouth producing those words. I can\'t remember if my brain formulated them. I stared, unwavering, at the breakroom table.\nI expected User to laugh at me. To tell me that she told me so. To snark something about "my science" and "how it wasn\'t helping me now." But when I looked up, I saw in her eyes a maternal softness I hadn\'t encountered before.\nShe laid a wrinkled, sun-spotted hand over my mine.\n"I\'m working the evening shift at Mystic Mists on Main Street tonight," she said. "I\'ll give you 50% off on protective hematite if you come in before closing."\n***\nI wasn\'t going to buy protective hematite. I really wasn\'t.\nTen minutes into the last star show of the day, Dr. User took a seat in the back of the planetarium. I felt my stomach drop. When the lights flicked on for the User , I tried to picture puppies and slurpees and ice cream cakes. Things that might possibly keep me from physically attacking the next person who asked me how I felt about the moon landing being really shot in Arizona. Somehow, I managed.\nBut right before the User session ended and I let the audience back out into the world, Dr. User caught my eye. She was gesticulating wildly. When I met her arm-thrashing with confusion, she sprang from her seat and jogged down the amphitheater steps to my podium. She grabbed the mike and bent it toward herself.\n"Just a reminder, ladies and gentlemen," she said, breathless. "As I\'m sure User mentioned, in two days, we will experience a total solar eclipse. I\'d like to formally invite you to attend our solar eclipse viewing party, beginning at 3:45 AM on Wednesday. We will broadcast live footage of the sky in Botswana as we track the path of the moon between the earth and the sun. There will be coloring and crafts for the kiddies, and plenty of hard liquor for the adults. User will be bartending!" Dr. User slapped my shoulder.\nThere was some grumbling from the fifteen-or-so people in the audience, the majority of whom had already started to file out of the planetarium.\n"Bartending?" I asked.\n"Didn\'t I tell you to start broadcasting the User sky a week ago? I wanted it projected on the smartboard, right next to the countdown. You have no idea how to hype anything, do you?"\nShe frowned at my countdown. I watched her erase my bubble-letter two, and replace it with a big, bubble-lettered one, which she decorated with squiggles and stars and suns.\nFor a moment, I thought I felt my throat constrict.\nI couldn\'t get out of the Newton Center fast enough.\nAnd even though I was going to meet User in two hours and I hadn\'t eaten anything since lunch, I decided to take the long way home. The way through Main Street.\n***\nThe shops on Main Street run together, like some quaint, old-city downtown. It\'s incongruous. Cobblestone walking-streets and little pretty storefronts and that sell pricey antiques and art pieces to New Yorkers who stumble into our town off Route 22. A small patch of pristine tourism planted in desolate-opiate wilderness. Parking has gotten worse in recent years, and the majority of the people you see downtown aren\'t wearing ratty Grateful Dead band shirts and sunburn anymore. There are more button-downs and khakis than faded jeans and motorcycle beards. Yet, the money only flickers in. It never stays.\nI expected Mystic Mists to smell like patchouli. In fact, it smelled like a fruity Glade air freshener. User was behind the counter, and a Fleetwood Mac song on the radio faded into User , circa 1998.\n"Mary-Beth," she cooed. She sounded genuinely happy to see me. "You just missed User ."\n" User ?" I said, as my eyes fell on the "sweet grass smudge stick" on sale on a shelf beside me.\n"Our psychic healer," User said. "You could really use a User session."\n"I bet I could," I said. I could really use anything, at this point. "Is that, like, psychedelic mushrooms?"\n"It\'s an energy cleansing," User lowered her eyelids. She crossed her arms like a dragon, fearsome and unimpressed.\n"Oh," I said, and examined a Himalayan salt lamp. "So do you have any psychedelic mushrooms?"\n"New age spirituality is about becoming more aware, not deluding yourself with intoxicants and poisons."\n"That\'s a no, then?" I asked, as I glanced at the bottles of CBD oil. I couldn\'t hide the disappointment in my voice.\n User climbed out from around the front counter, grabbed my wrist in a pinching hold, and dragged me to the back of the shop. "These," she waved her hands above a bucket shelf filled with a black, reflective gemstone, "you need some of these. User ."\nShe pulled a little mesh, drawstring bag from one of her peasant skirt\'s pockets and shoveled a scoop of hematite into it.\n"You could probably use some rose quartz too," User said, "heaven knows when was the last time you got laid."\nAs User moved from one gem bucket to another, my gaze fell on a shelf of what looked like little pink perfume bottles, with heart-shaped crystal stoppers. I picked one up. The label read: Love Potion, No. 9. I flipped it over to read the ingredients on the back, but none were listed. Just a one-line direction: Apply to pulse points while chanting your lover\'s name, 30 minutes before your next rendezvous.\n A love potion. User \'s sardonic joke from this morning hit me. Perhaps, I thought, like a madwoman, that this was some universe-delivered sign. I rolled the bottle over in my hand. It was only $9.99. Cheap. I wondered if it could counteract a month of Buzzfeed\'s black magic for that price. At the very least, it would be a good gag gift.\n What am I thinking? I asked myself. It could only be a gag gift. There is no such thing as magic. I was losing my mind, that had to be it. I reread the potion\'s instructions. But an onset of schizophrenia or not, I decided I was buying one. It was harmless. Holding the bottle made me feel somehow a little bit better. And since I was insane, I needed something to feel a little bit better.\n"There," User said, and tightened the bag closed, "that might be enough to keep you from killing yourself Wednesday." She noticed the little bottle in my hand.\n"Oh, good thinking. I\'ve seen that potion work absolute wonders. Plus, the bottle is made from rose quartz. Together that\'s some potent stuff," she giggled. "Got a boy in mind?"\n"Not for me," I said, as I reached for my wallet. "I was thinking it might be good for a friend."\n"Sure," she took the potion from me and carried it and the little drawstring bag of gemstones to the cash register.\n***'b'\nI got home about an hour before User was supposed to show up and help me reorganize my life. I boiled water for ramen, washed the stack of dirty dishes in the kitchen sink, and looked to see if my brother was home (thankfully, he wasn\'t).\nAs I cooked my packet of ramen noodles, I tried to remember a day I did not eat them for at least one of my major meals. When I couldn\'t, I began to wonder if my high-sodium diet had caused my Buzzfeed hallucinations. The fact User experienced them was no consolation. I wondered if she was actually the User I had grown up beside, and not an especially realistic mirage of a friend I once had. There was no way someone as cool as she was could be stuck in the same hell I was. \nIn an attempt to cut back the sodium, I skipped the beef seasoning packet, drained the noodles, and drenched them in soy sauce and Chinese mustard. It was all very pathetic. I, pathetic, sat at the kitchen table eating my pathetic ramen, alternatively watching the microwave clock and my iPhone.  \nAt 40 minutes before Rafi\'s ETA, I texted my pothead prince. \nYou\'ll be here at 9, right?\nWithin a minute, he had responded. \nYou got it dude\nAt 35 minutes, I scrambled for the plastic bag full of black magic I\'d bought from User \'s store. I pulled out the love potion bottle and reread the directions four times.\nAt 31 minutes I unscrewed the love potion\'s lid and took a whiff. It smelled like diluted rose water. I was willing to bet that it was actually diluted rose water. \nAt 30 minutes, I dabbed the diluted rose water on my wrists and neck and chanted the incantation User , like I was a medieval heretic, or an 1980s Satanist about to draw a pentagram. \n            At 15 minutes, I felt a familiar anxiety gnawing at the pit of my stomach.\n            At 5 minutes, I frantically scrolled through Instagram, liking memes I didn\'t even find funny.\n            At 1 minute, I heard the doorbell ring. At 30 seconds, my phone buzzed.\n            A text message.\n I\'m here.   \n***\n            "So what you\'re saying is that you\'ve got research experience." User couldn\'t stifle his grin. "Employers love that shit."\n            "I didn\'t publish anything," I shook my head. "I don\'t think it counts-"\n            "What do you mean it doesn\'t count?" User crossed his arms, "you won awards for original scientific research you did as an undergrad. You already know how to use scientific principles to answer technical questions. That\'s like, 90% of engineering."\n            "Physics isn\'t engineering," I said.\n            "True," User said, "engineering is watered-down physics. You\'re more qualified to do my job than I am."\n            I blinked.\n            "So this is what I\'m going to do," User took my laptop and turned it toward him. I waited for him to finish his sentence, but he did not. Instead, he tapped the keyboard furiously. I watched him. Sometimes, he\'d stop typing and I\'d watch his gaze move back over his work. He\'d read, smirk a small, satisfied smirk, and then tap furiously again. \n            After about ten minutes, he turned the laptop screen toward me. \n            The template he had sent me was no longer the sparse apology I had created in my first attempt a few days ago. It looked like a real resume. I was shocked. It had to have been filled with lies.\n            "Summa cum laude recent grad with strong technical background and research experience. Original thinker, dependable teammate, and skilled communicator who can tell a good joke," User read the summary aloud. \n            Beneath this was my education, GPA and major. Courses I had taken in my major (all were cross-listed with engineering), and then a section about my research project and the awards I won. I hadn\'t published it, mainly because my mom\'s illness took up too much of my time to revise a 50-page thesis for publication. And the awards were all university-granted prizes that never occurred to me could impress an employer. None of any of my background had seemed employable. But now that I saw bolded phrases like "created models" and "designed research" and "Mechanics 361" and "collaborated with engineering department" and "first-place" spotted all over the place, I felt differently. It seemed, all of a sudden, that the version of myself that User had cut and pasted and edited onto paper could still be somebody.\n            Maybe, I thought, if a person like User thought I could be somebody- maybe I really could still be somebody. \n            "Well," User said. His gaze bounced around my face. "What do you think?"\n            I realized I hadn\'t said anything.\n            "I like you," I squeaked. \n            He laughed. \n            "I like you too."\n            "How did you do this? You made me sound so smart and cool and employable?" I squeaked again.\n            "Easy," User said. "I just told the truth."\n            I grinned so hard my cheeks hurt. My heart hurt. It was over. I was done. I silently prayed to whatever God existed, to whatever force still controlled the universe, that the diluted rosewater on my pulse points would make him fall hopelessly in love with me. \n            ***\n            I don\'t know what I expected to happen. I guess I wanted evidence my black magic worked. I wanted User to behave differently than he had any other previous day. But he didn\'t.  After we finished putting together my LinkedIn and watching a few episodes of DS9 on Netflix, Rafi just put his arm around my shoulder and talked about his favorite strain of kush and how first thing he wanted to do when he got back to California was to drive up to Fresno and go to a Triangle Burger, because a friend of a cousin out there had said it was better than any In-N-Out.\n            And when we went up to my bedroom, he held me just as he had before. Like I was very dear to him. But not someone he couldn\'t live without. \n            And, as pathetic as I had become, I decided that wasn\'t good enough for me. \n            After he fell asleep, I rolled on my side and picked up my phone. I hatched another plan. The first thing I needed to do was learn how to get on the dark web. \nI needed something more potent than black magic.\n***'b'\nI met him at a Panera. His name was User . He wore, as he said he would, a t-shirt with Nintendo\'s Chain Chomp on the front. He was in his early thirties with graying blonde hair and an aging baby face. He was pretty much what I expected. \n"So before we get started," User asked when I sat down, "how did you find out about me?"\n"Why do you ask?" I said in a smoky mezzo-soprano I had hoped would disguise my real voice.\n"Market research. See my flakey girlfriend\'s doing my marketing," he replied. "I don\'t think it\'s been super effective."\n"Oh," I mumbled. "Craigslist ad."\n"A Craigslist ad?" Tim cringed. "She\'s advertising me on Craigslist now?"\n"Yeah," I said. \n            Something must have clicked in his mind, because his eyes widened.\n            "You were looking for a Network Engineer on Craigslist?"\n "Well, I started on Upwork," I began, "but I felt like nobody there is capable of doing what I require. I realized I might need to go on the dark web."\n"You know that Craigslist is not the dark web, right?" he chuckled.\n"I mean, it\'s darker than Upwork," I said, like a baby rabbit.\n"Eh," he squinted, "Upwork is a gig-economy yuppie hellsite. It\'s plenty dark."\n"Well, Craigslist is the darkest of the freelancing sites." I said. "It\'s midnight dark."\n"Um, actually," he lifted an index finger like a walking stereotype, "one, you\'re forgetting Fiverr. Fiverr is stub-your-toe-on-your-bedpost-dark. Two, Craigslist is not a freelancing site. You use Craigslist to sell old TVs to strangers in mall parking lots. Not to freelance."\n"Um, actually," I said, "I found your stupid name in a stupid Craigslist ad and you are freelancing so here we are."\n"Touche," he conceded. "Look, what kind of job do you need?"\n"I need you to redirect a website for me," I said.\n"What do you mean?" he tilted his head.\n"Like redirect a website so that a url goes to another page," I said.\n"Is this your website?" he asked. \n"No," I said.\n"Welp then, no," he said. He pressed his hands flat on the tabletop as if he were about to stand up. \n"You couldn\'t like, take Buzzfeed, and make it so that every time somebody visited Buzzfeed.com they\'d like be directed to another website?"\n"What," User snickered, "did one of their quizzes tell you you were gonna die alone?"                                                                                \n"Not exactly. I mean," I caught myself, "I\'m just sick of Buzzfeed."\n"You got User in a Disney princess quiz, didn\'t you?" \n"No," I went for broke, " User is a danger to society, and I don\'t think anybody should have to look at it anymore." \n"Um, see," User blinked and shook his head. "I could redirect User to another page for you or your router, but not for the whole Internet. What you\'re talking about doing here is a malicious redirect."\nThat there was a name for my idea encouraged me.  \n"So it\'s possible?" I asked. \n"If you want to go to jail, I guess," User shrugged. "I\'m not going to jail over User though." \n"What if I paid you, like, triple your normal rate," I clutched at an ephemeral hope that faded as User \'s shoulders jolted up and down. \n"Not enough," User said. \n"Quadruple?" I pleaded. \n"Listen," he stood up. "You\'d need a ton of money to hire someone to carry out a pointless cyberattack on Buzzfeed. You don\'t have that kind of money. If you did, you wouldn\'t be poking around for network engineers on Craigslist."\nThe truth stung. I slumped back in my chair.\n***\n            I stopped at User \'s on the way home from Panera. She was out of work, and I was having a medical emergency. I had to see her. When she answered the door, she was still in her scrubs. She took one glance at me and already looked concerned.\n            I don\'t recall how I ended up face-first in the shag rug of User \'s mom\'s living room, but I\'m not sure it was a conscious choice. I could hardly breathe as User got herself a beer from the kitchen. I heard her footsteps, and then, she gently turned my head so that I could see her. \n"Okay, one more time. You tried to hire a guy to do what?" User smiled the way people smile at lunatics or User tigers. Slowly, slowly, backing away.\n            "Redirect Buzzfeed to another website," I replied, in a voice that shocked even me. I sounded as though that was completely a reasonable thing to do. "So like, if you googled User and clicked on a link to it or like, typed the URL in, the internet would take you to like, Mashable or something."\n            "That\'s crafty," User said.\n            "It\'s illegal," I said, "and I didn\'t have enough money to convince the guy to do it."\n            "So you can do that?" User took a swig of her beer. "That\'s a thing people can do?"\n            " User ," I said. "I\'m willing to break the law, at this point."\n            "If you did redirect User , what would that accomplish exactly?" \n             "I didn\'t think that far ahead," I replied. "I guess I just thought cutting off all access to them would encourage them to stop."\n            "How do we know they\'re actually doing anything, though," User pontificated, "maybe they have no power to change anything. Maybe they\'re just showing us our fate. Maybe our anger at them is misplaced."\n            "But they\'ve got to know telling people their future is damaging," I said, with a mouthful of shag rug. "Every work of science fiction tells us so. They\'re trying to ruin our lives."\n            "Maybe you should email them and find out what their game is," User suggested. "You can\'t defeat an enemy you don\'t know."\n            "You don\'t just, like, email User . What do you think, User is your Aunty? HEeeEeeELLlllLOOoo User , hOoOoOow arrRrRReEEee yOoooOuUuu, bYyY tTHhHEe wAAaaAYy pLEeaAAasSeEee stTOooOPp fUuCCcKIiNgG User meEEeEEee, itTt\'s ruUuUdeEE."\n            "Well, you don\'t have a lot of options, do you?" User shrugged. "You\'ve tried hiring a hacker, you\'ve tried building a community quiz, you\'ve tried..." \n            "Crystals and love potions," I finished the sentence that User trailed off. "Nothing."\n            "Love potions?" \n            I could hear User \'s eyebrows raise.\n            I reached into my pants pocket and tossed my car keys at her.\n            "Front passenger seat of my car," I said. "Go get it, it\'s yours. Doesn\'t work for me."\n            I coughed on the shag rug.\n            I wanted to bust out of my body. I wanted the mothership to land in the front yard of User \'s childhood home and I wanted little gray men to abduct me. \n            "Look at us," I said into the rug. "We\'re not women. We\'re aliens. We\'re not even women aliens. We\'re alien children."\n            When User did not reply I looked over my shoulder at the sofa on which she had been perched. Nothing.\n            I sat up.\n            " User ?"\n            "Hold on," User called from the foyer hallway, "gotta get that potion. Mama has a date tonight."\n            I heard her front door open and then quickly shut.\n***'b'\n User left me on her mom\'s living room floor. I dissociated for about an hour. Then, I picked up my phone. The last time I wrote an email, I was in college.\n            I clicked on the first "Contacts at Buzzfeed" link that came up on Google. I was presented with eight links.\n Advertise On BuzzFeed\n            Share Tips with Buzzfeed News\n            Copyright/DMCA Issue\n            Licensing \n            Press Relations\n            Video Feedback\n            Community Help\n            Technical Support\n            I focused on the last two. I couldn\'t determine whether the uncanny accuracy of Buzzfeed\'s quiz results was a technical problem or a community one. I decided to send feedback to them both.\n            Hello,\n            So, for the last 3-ish weeks, I\'ve taken your quizzes. I\'m on to your sick game. I just want to know why you\'ve decided to reveal my future to me. Is it not torment enough to be young and poor in this decade? Why must you taunt me with the fact that I can\'t change the course of my life as it unfolds before me? Have you no human compassion? You have robbed me of any false hope that otherwise might have sustained me through the rest of my woeful life. I look forward only to being swallowed back up into primordial clay. \nBest,\nLeela\n             I pressed the "Send Feedback" button and wandered into User \'s kitchen. I found User \'s bottle of gin and tonic and poured myself a glass. It tasted like how I imagine Canada smells. Fresh. Green. Free. Like the sweet sweat of a lumberjack. \n            When User \'s mom came home from the grocery store, she found me blaring "Last Christmas" and munching on the slab of stale baking chocolate I found in the pantry. \n             "One of those days?" She asked, as she put the coffee creamer in her fridge. \n            "One of those years," I replied.\n            She steeped a cup of Chai tea and then left me alone in the kitchen. I checked my email. \n            A response from communityhealth@buzzfeed.com:\n            Hello Buzzfeed Community Member,\n            Thanks for your ~totes BOMB~ feedback. Unfortunately, the whole Buzzfeed team is away for the ~BOTSWANAN SOLAR ECLIPSE~ so nobody is gonna probs answer you for like, a hot second. In the meantime, enjoy this sick meme of User dabbing while an eclipsed User dances around her.\nLATER DAYS,\n User \nBeneath the automated message was a gif of User dabbing while an eclipsed User danced around her. \nI walked to the living room and collapsed onto the shag carpet. I don\'t remember what I did after that.\n***'b'\n User woke me around 2:30AM. She was giggling like hyena. My head pounded. I couldn\'t quite understand what she was saying. There was an empty family-sized carton of pizza-flavored Goldfish crackers beside me. I was covered in Reese User wrappers and orange crumbs. I wasn\'t wearing pants. I felt like a warthog in a mud bath. A hung over warthog.\n            "Did you hear what I just said?" User shoved me.\n            I cringed at her and rubbed my arms.\n            "Your stupid love potion," she said. "It\'s magic."\n            "What?" I asked.\n            " User asked me to move in with him!" She squealed. "I\'m going to live in a pool house!"\n            "Okay?" I said, and glanced around. I was still in the living room. I swallowed. Something stringy and dry was in mouth. I tried to cough it out.\n            "He told me he\'s in love with me, and that he wants to get serious," User hugged her chest, "and the weirdest thing is I\'m not even freaked out by it. Like I want to move in with him."\n            Whatever was in my mouth could not be coughed out.\n            "A guy can be seriously into me, and I can still find him attractive," User beamed.\nI reached into my mouth and pulled out a string I must have inhaled from the shag carpet. I gagged.\n"You know what this means? I\'m not completely broken!" User grabbed my arms and shook me. "I might be cut out for adult relationships after all!"\nI felt another carpet string in my throat. My eyes began to water.\n"Oh no," I gasped.\n"Oh yes!" User pulled me into a hug. I pushed her away from me. \nI managed to make it to the downstairs bathroom before I threw up. Abby- or the strange, love-struck, bubbly person she had become- danced in the hallway outside the bathroom door. I could hear her singing User "Bleeding Love" as I spat out semi-sweet, Christmas-flavored stomach bile into her mother\'s toilet. \n***\nI emerged from the bathroom to find that User had situated herself in her bed. She\'d pulled out my designated sleeping bag and opened it on her bedroom floor. It took me until I was zipping myself in when I fully realized what User had been so excited about.\n"So, wait, you\'re actually going to move in with User ?" \nI would have been bitter that the potion didn\'t work so well for me, but I had never expected it to. And the sweet half-smile present on User \'s sleepy face made up for any ping of jealously I might have felt.\n"I told him I would," User said. "It came out so fast, I surprised myself."\n"So like, you\'re not worried about his ex anymore?" I asked.\n"We talked about that actually," User said. "We talked about a lot of things tonight. I told him I was a little insecure, because I am so different from all the girls he\'s dated before. He told me that he was the one who broke up with his fianc. They had different interests. She wants to go into politics. She likes galas and press events and white wine. At the end of the day, he just wants a quiet life next to his family."\n"So he\'s not still in love with her?" I asked.\n"He cares about her the way a normal person would care about somebody they almost married," she said.\n"I guess they always do say not to date somebody who is bitter about an ex."\n"Plus, he told me that because I\'m different, he feels differently about me," User said. "He was always trying to keep up with his ex. He feels like he can just be himself around me. And everything has been so lowkey and easy."\n"So do you, like, love him?" I asked.\n"We\'re very happy together," User said. \n"But do you love him?" It all seemed very sudden to me. They\'d been together for only a few weeks. A month tops. I wasn\'t sure how you could seriously love a person within a month of the awkward first date. Fall in love- sure, but love-love? Move-in-together love? User , for all her devil-may-care-flying-solo attitude, was the last person I\'d expect to fall into a whirlwind romance, black-magicked or not. \n"I mean," User gazed up at the ceiling, "he\'s different than other guys. I feel things."\n"Things?" I asked.\n"You know like when you\'re having a shitty day, and you feel like you have nothing to look forward to?" \n"Except being swallowed back up into primordial clay," I nodded.\n"And then you remember that you have a new carton of ice cream in the freezer back home?" User continued. "So like, you can ignore all the stupid shit flung at you, because you know when you get home you\'ll have ice cream. You know that feeling?"\n"Yeah," I said.\n"That\'s how I feel. I don\'t know if that\'s love or not, but it\'s how I feel. The kicker is that I\'ll meet a random hot guy, who I know probably has both of his testicles and is taller than User and probably stronger than him. I still don\'t want to date User any less. Like, I know I have ice cream at home." \n"Wow," I said. \n"Yeah," User smiled. "Like, he drives me crazy sometimes with his philosophy, but, like, he\'s still my favorite ice cream."\nI supposed that did sound like love. \n"How do you feel about User ?" User asked.\n"Like he\'s perfect and I don\'t know what he\'s even doing with me."\n"He doesn\'t make you feel like you have ice cream in the freezer?" \n"I mean," I squinted, "it\'s more like, somebody gave me a two-scoop cone of some weird foreign-flavor ice cream that I can\'t afford but is very good and while I\'m enjoying it, I\'m afraid it\'s going to melt onto the floor and I won\'t be able to just go to the Wegmans and buy more of it because it was a fluke that I got it in the first place."\n  User blinked.\n"Just the sound of that is giving me anxiety," she said. "Only you could give me anxiety over ice cream."\n"We\'re not all User , you know." I said. "I\'m sorry I don\'t make you feel like you\'re in a sugar coma."\n"He\'s the sweetest sugar coma," she sighed.\n"So like, if things went so well tonight," I asked, "why did you come home? Why not just stay the night?"\n"I have work tomorrow, so I was going to have to come home and get my scrubs and shower and stuff. Speaking of which," User checked her phone, "I got to sleep."\n"Right," I said, as User reached for the beside lamp. The idea of User getting ready for work reminded me of my own job, and then, the date. \n"Wait," I said. User froze.\n"What time is it?" \n"3:22, AM."\n"Oh shit." I pulled my phone out of my pocket. "It\'s the day of the fucking eclipse." \n"So?"\n"I need to be at work in 18 minutes," I moaned. "I have to bartend for the stupid eclipse viewing party."\n"You\'re kidding?" User snorted.\n"I wish," I said as I bolted upward. Still zipped into my sleeping bag, I tripped over my feet and fell face first back onto the floor.  \n***'b'I managed to pull into the Newton Center\'s parking lot at 3:29. \n            I expected to find the place abandoned. Imagine my shock, then, when I saw throngs of people crowding around the Newton Center\'s front door. \n            There were hardly any available parking spots. When I found one, I parked as quickly as I could and literally ran toward the entrance, while searching my keyring for my work key. It took me until I was dead in the middle of the crowd to realize that the people who had gathered there weren\'t eagerly awaiting an eclipse viewing party. They were protestors. \n            As I tried to swerve around one doomsday prepper, a tinfoil-hat obstructed my way with a poster board sign, upon which "HELLWORLD" had been written in flame-colored bubble letters. Before I could find an alternate path to the front door, I felt hot breath on the back of my neck.  \n            "I remember her! It\'s a deep state shill!" A man shouted behind me. "She told my kids the earth was round!"\n            And with that, the mob turned its attention on me. \n            "Eugenicist!" A granola woman growled at me. \n"Pedophile sympathizer!"\n"Don\'t disrespect our FLAG!"\n            Someone grabbed me. So this, I thought, this is how I die. \n            I closed my eyes and prepared for death, when the hands that had clasped around my arms suddenly released me. I opened my eyes.\n             User stood on top the barrel chest of a protestor, bloody python-cleaver in her hands. \n            The mob around us seemed stunned into brief inaction. \n            "Get inside!" User hissed at me, "and next time use the back door like a professional!"\n            I darted to the front door as the mob turned on User . I thought to hold the door open for her. I looked behind me. User sliced the face of a mouth-foaming anti-vaxer. \n            "Shut the damn door, User ," she called over her shoulder. "This ain\'t my first rodeo!"\n            "But," I shouted through the opened crack of the door, "don\'t you also believe the earth is flat?"\n            "Loyalty first, kid!" She smiled at me, then swung her cleaver between the eyes of a clawing flat-earther. \n            As I walked to the planetarium, I passed Dr. User standing by the lobby\'s large glass windows. She chewed on her nails.\n            "Poor Janice," I said as blood splattered on the window nearest to us. \n            "I knew I never should have advertised the party on Twitter," Dr. User sighed, "but what the board wants, the board gets."\nShe pulled out her iPhone.\n            "Calling the cops?" I asked.\n            "Are you crazy?" Dr. User cringed. "The last thing we need is the brown shirts involved." She started filming the riot. "I\'m going to tweet Anifa. Call in reinforcements."\n***\n            Aside from the mob violence, the viewing party was a low-key event.\n            I switched on NASA\'s live stream at 3:45. User came back inside at about 3:50. She wore a bloodied crystal necklace I hadn\'t seen before. I assume she had taken it off one of the protestors, but we didn\'t talk about that. \n            For most of the eclipse, the only people "partying" were Newton Center staff, Cody, Ky, few other furries, and seven Wiccans meditating on the planetarium floor.\n***\n            The total solar eclipse started at 4:07 AM. At first, I was scared. By 4:08 AM, when much of the Kalahari was swathed in eerie midday darkness, I was shaking-terrified. By 4:15 AM, when the moon had passed beyond the path of the sun, I felt nothing at all.\n***\n            The viewing party officially ended at 5:00 AM. It unofficially ended at 11:30 AM, when I had to wake Dr. User up from her tequila stupor. I walked User and Cody to the Center\'s side doors. And then I crept to the lobby\'s large windows to survey the damage. \n            The crowd of protestors thinned out when the counter-protestors arrived and started throwing User bottles full of piss at them. By now, there was no one left. The parking lot was empty, save for a summer camp bus that arrived mid-morning.\n            I walked outside and checked the sidewalk for evidence of the violence. All I found the same HELLWORLD poster, now bloodied and reeking of urine. I thought about picking it up and disposing it somewhere, but I didn\'t have rubber gloves.\n            "Looks like the viewing party was lit," a familiar voice said behind me.\n            I turned around. \n            The late morning sun haloed User \'s blonde head. He was beautiful. I loved him.\n            "Hey," I mumbled.\n            "I really meant to attend," User eyed the poster, "but I smoked a little too late last night and didn\'t wake up till 10. Slept right through the alarm."\n            "You wanted to come to the viewing party?" I asked. "You set an alarm?"\n            "How else would I get to see you bartend?" He smirked.\n            I blinked. \n            "Come on, let\'s get lunch," he said. "You look like you can use some fries, and I have some excellent news."\n            He took my hand. My stomach dropped. \n            ***'b' User wanted to carpool, but instead I followed him in my own car. \n      I pulled in the spot next to his Civic. As I stepped out into the humid heat of the User \'s parking lot, he punched the air. \n"Bumper buddies," he sing-sang.\nI couldn\'t help but smile.\nHe was such a happy soul. He was sunlight. He was the center of the entire sky. \nI was going to be sick.\nWe ordered square-shaped hamburgers and fries and slid into a red booth in the sunny end of the restaurant. The place had retro diner vibes. I felt like I was in an early Radiohead music video you can\'t find on YouTube anymore. It seemed as though at any moment a car bomb could go off. \n"So, let\'s start with excellent news part one." User dunked a fry into my ketchup. "There\'s an entry level engineering job opening at S. Schwartz."\n User ?" The green-roofed building down the road from my old middle school. Once, when I was in seventh grade, the wood-shop room caught on fire and we were evacuated to User . On the rainy half-mile walk there, I remember having a conversation with an old classmate about the existence of guardian angels. She believed in them, and I only wished I did.\n"Their North American headquarters. My Aunt works HR there. She\'s always talked about how great the culture and benefits are."\n"So," I was hit by a wave of hope, "are you thinking about applying there or something?"\n"It\'s aerospace engineering," he shook his head. " User is an aerospace company." \n"Ok?" I said.\n"Well, it\'s not SpaceX, but it would be a very good start. At least to figure out what engineering jobs are actually like." User pulled up the job post on his phone, and I realized, all at once, that he thought this would be a very good start for me.\n"Wait," I said, "I\'m not qualified for this-"\n"You are qualified for this," User said. "I compared your resume to the post. You already hit like, eighty percent of the requirements." \n"That\'s only eighty percent," I said.\n"Right," he smiled a confused smile. "You\'re qualified. They know they aren\'t going to get everything they ask for in the post."\n"I mean," I eyed the green User logo on the page header and thought about angels and fire. User laid a warm hand on my wrist. \n"You don\'t know if you want to go to grad school, but you do know you want a better job, right?" His voice was soft and sweet.\n"Right," I said. I couldn\'t disagree with him.\n"So, the only way forward is to get a better job. If you realize you hate engineering, you can always go to grad school later, when you\'ve saved up more money. So you\'d apply, right?"\n"I don\'t know," I said. \n"Ugh," User slouched backwards into his seat. "I knew you\'d say that."\n"Well," I said. I watched him smirk.\n"So don\'t be mad," User said. "I filled out an application for you and sent it in."\n"What?"  \n      "Don\'t worry, I didn\'t write a cover letter for you or anything," his eyes widened with sincerity, "I just plopped your name and phone number and email address in the form fields and attached the resume we worked on together and BOOM."\n      I couldn\'t believe him.\n "Are you mad?" He pursed his lips and squinted and lifted his eyebrows. He looked guilty, despite himself.\nI couldn\'t be mad. When I told him this, his face broke into that giant, kid-ish grin of his. \nBy then, we\'d finished our lunches. I got up to dump my burger wrapper and turn in my tray. User followed me to the trash can.\n"If you want," he said, "I can email your resume to my aunt. Just to make sure your resume gets in front of the people who need to see it."\n"That sounds like nepotism," I cringed. \n"It\'s cool," User held up hands, "if you\'re not comfortable with that, I won\'t do it. Just thought I would offer you a chance to play all the cards in your hand."\nWe walked out of the User \'s and were greeted again with hot summer air.\n"All the cards in my hand," I repeated, amused. "It\'s a garbage hand."\n"Not at all." He said. Something in his tone caught my eye. I looked up at him. "You\'ve got a lot of aces," he said. "More than you think you do."\nBy then, we had gotten to our cars.\nHe leaned against the passenger side of his car as I stood by the driver\'s side of mine. There was soft, barely-palpable breeze that lifted up just a few of his curls. He looked at me for what seemed like a long time. His eyelids were heavier than usual. I didn\'t know if he was going to kiss me. I hoped he would.\n"So, I didn\'t tell you excellent news part two," he finally said.\nI admired the curve of his full lips. The cupid\'s bow. The white glow of his teeth.\n"I got a call from California this morning. The MMJ company wants to hire me. They\'re going to fly me out on Friday."\nMy vision blurred. My face stung. User had been right, all along. This was the eclipse.'b'"Wow," I said, like an android suffering an emotion-chip malfunction. "Congrats."\n"You don\'t sound happy," User said. I wasn\'t sure if he was hurt or confused. I reached behind my back for the handle of my car door. \n"No, that\'s exactly how you wanted things to turn out so it\'s honestly very cool." \n User searched my eyes and I became hyper aware of the expression on my face. I think I momentarily forgot how to smile. I overcompensated and grinned. He tilted his head to left with a movement so slight it was almost imperceptible.\n"Well, I guess I should change out of this work uniform," I tugged on my polo with one hand and pulled open my car door with another.\n"Ok," he pressed his hand against the car door. Softly. Not aggressively enough to shut it. "Tell me how you\'re feeling."\nI couldn\'t believe how I was feeling. I\'d only known him a couple of weeks.\n"I\'m happy," I said, to Rafi and to myself. I liked him, a lot. I might have loved him. I was definitely in love with him. I should be happy he\'s about to start living his dream. "You told me when we met you wanted to go to California and it\'s awesome everything worked out the way it was supposed to." \nHe didn\'t look convinced.\n"I guess I\'m just surprised everything\'s happening so fast. I know I shouldn\'t be."\nIt was like a light bulb flashed on above User \'s head. \n"Hey," he glanced briefly over his shoulder at the teenagers sipping Frostees on the parking curbs behind us. "Why don\'t we get in my car for a little, we should talk."\nI was sure I knew what was going to happen as soon as he opened his mouth to speak. Nonetheless, I watched myself climb into his passenger seat.\n***\n"So, I want to apologize for the timing," User said. "I don\'t know what I expected when I sat down next to you at Cody\'s party, but it wasn\'t this."\nMy face burned. \n"Wasn\'t what?"\n User sighed.\n"Wasn\'t you. I wasn\'t expecting you." \n"I\'m sorry." \n"Why are you apologizing?" User \'s eyebrows lifted. "I want to hang out all the time with you because I like you so, so much. I meant I wasn\'t expecting to meet somebody like you now, at my fuckup cousin\'s sausage fest."\n"Okay?" \n"Okay so I don\'t know what to do?" User shrugged. "Like, is this going to be a serious relationship? Do we try for long distance? Is it too early to try for long distance?"\nI swear I could feel vomit creep up my throat. \n"Do you want to do long distance?" I asked back. I think User could hear the hope in my voice.\n"You know," he looked at the floor of his User and smiled. "I never thought I would. But now I\'m not so sure. If it was anybody else, it\'d be a no."\n"I mean," I trailed off.\n"Like, on one hand," User said, "We just started talking, and long distance is hard. On the other hand, this is going to sound corny as fuck, but, I\'m just weirdly drawn to you."\n"You are?" I squeaked.\nHe laughed. Hard. I realized then he had turned his whole torso toward me. \n"No, I just take a Good Samaritan interest in the passions and dreams and futures of random introverts I meet at parties," he said. "Of course, I\'m drawn to you. Have been since I saw you sitting on Cody\'s porch there. I can\'t really explain it," he fumbled with his words, "it\'s like, uh"\n"Black magic?" I volunteered.\nHe furrowed his brow.\n"No," he said, "black magic is supposed to be bad right? It\'s like, kismet."\nAnd then he winced. "Is that weird? Did I make it weird?"\n"No," I said, and I heard him exhale. "So what next?"\n"Well, what do you want to do?" He asked.\nThe next thing I said spilled out of me:\n"I want to move out to California with you."\n User theatrically reached for the transmission, "Well let\'s go pack." And then, just when I felt I might faint, he burst into giggles. I did not. \nHe blinked when he realized I wasn\'t laughing with him. \n"You\'re serious?"\n"Sure," I said. "The only thing I\'ve got going for me is you."\nHis creaky laugh made me cringe. \n"Stop saying that," he smiled, but he sounded irked. "How many times do I have to tell you to stop cutting yourself down like that?"\n"What I meant to say," I watched his eyes soften, "is you\'ve really been the only thing that\'s made me happy since my mom got sick."\n"Oh Lee," he said, and I think my heart broke. \nHe held his arms out, and when I didn\'t move toward him quickly enough, he pulled me toward him. I was confused.\n"I like you so much," he kissed my forehead.\n"Okay," I said. \n"So," User didn\'t let go of me. "If you went to California with me, what would you do?"\n"I dunno," I said. \n"What would you want to do?" User pulled away just far enough to look into my eyes. \n" User you dinner?" I asked, like a grade-schooler at a spelling bee.\n"You don\'t even cook yourself dinner," he laughed, "don\'t think I haven\'t noticed your ramen collection."\n"I could start?" I guessed. "I could clean your apartment too."\n"Are you serious?" User now leaned back into his seat. His arms retreated onto his lap. " User , do you hear yourself right now?"\n"Yes?" \n"You\'re offering to be my maid." User said.\n"Maids are people too!" I said. "There\'s nothing wrong with being a maid!"\n"I know that," User said. "And if you had always been a User and User rolled into one and weren\'t coming off," his voiced cracked, "what happened to you last year, I\'d believe that maybe you\'d might always be cool with cleaning and cooking for me."\n"I think I\'m a better judge of what I\'m cool with than somebody who isn\'t even me-"\n" User ," User said. "I love that I make you happy." His body shifted to face the street in front of us. "But I\'m worried about you."\n"I\'m fine," I said. \n"You\'re not fine," he said. "I mean you are fine," he looked me up and down, "but you need something other than me that makes you happy."\n"So, there are more things in California I could do," I said. "I could probably apply to a grad school or something there." \n"Would that make you happy?"\n"Yes," I lied. \nHis gaze bounced around my face. \n"What if I wasn\'t in California and you had to go to grad school in California there alone. Would that make you happy?"\nI nodded.\n"Be honest."\n"I don\'t know?" I said. \n User sighed.\n"But why does that even matter? Who in their twenties knows what will make them happy? Why can\'t you just let me come with you?" I asked. I realized I\'d lost the plot here, but I couldn\'t help what I said next. "If you were all that into me, wouldn\'t you want me to?"\n"I am all that into you," User \'s honey eyes looked sincere and serious. "This crazy part of me is all-in on the idea of you flying out with me. But I\'m not moving a town over, I\'m moving across the country to a place you\'ve never been before, where the only person you\'d know will be me."\n"So what?" I said, "you\'re cool and I don\'t need a lot of people."\nHe shook his head.\n "See what if you coming out with me keeps you from discovering you\'d be a kickass engineer or that you belong in a research observatory. I couldn\'t be happy with that," he said, "and, in two years, you might not be happy with that either."\n He reached for my hand. He rubbed my palm with his thumb.\n"You\'re vulnerable right now, User ," he said.\nMy blood pressure went up.\n"I\'m not vulnerable," I said. "I\'m twenty-three, I\'m sober, I\'m self-aware, just because I\'ve seen some shit-"\n User \'s gaze fell to the floor.\n"Even User needed to eat and sleep," he mumbled.\n"What?" I said, even though I heard him fine.\nHe looked at me.\n"You\'re a real girl, User ," he said. "You\'re not a cyborg," he caught himself, "I mean, android- whatever it is you like to call yourself. You can\'t keep putting yourself in second place. You put yourself second to your school work, you put yourself second to caregiving- which in both cases was understandable and admirable. But I can\'t let you put yourself second to me."\n"I-" I didn\'t know what to say. And then I couldn\'t say anything.\nFor the first time since I graduated third grade, I felt my eyes well up. I blinked, but it was too late. A tear rolled onto my cheek.\nI couldn\'t mop it away before another one appeared. Soon, I felt a steady stream drip onto my neck and chest. User took a Kleenex pack from his center console. He pulled out a tissue and I grabbed it from him before he could hand it to me.\n"I\'m leaking," I said.\nHe lunged forward and hugged me against his chest. It was an uncomfortable angle. The edge of console dug into my stomach. I didn\'t want him to let go.\n"I know it\'s crazy to say this now," he said, "and maybe I shouldn\'t, but here goes. I love you, space girl." \nI caught my breath and exhaled. I was heartbroken, of course. But I also felt a pang of something that resembled relief. \n***'b'We left the User \'s in his car and drove around aimlessly for a while. I don\'t think he wanted to let me go home. I certainly didn\'t want him to let me go. \n      We didn\'t say too much on the ride. I think we were both numb.\n      We pulled over beside a canola field a few streets down from his childhood home. Something compelled us to climb out of his Civic. The flowers were nearly as tall as I was, and, from where we stood, seemed to roll on forever. It was a stark landscape. Unending gold against a blue sky, which steadily darkened with gathering rainclouds. User took a few pictures of me on his phone, and I shot a selfie of the two of us. He wrapped his arms around my waist and told me to smile. I told him to quit paying attention to me and look at the camera. \n      When I looked at the selfie, I noticed that I was stone faced and his gaze rested on a spot at the top of my head. The spot where he would kiss me as soon as the camera flashed.\n      It wasn\'t too long after that it started to pour.\n***\n      We took shelter at his house. His parents weren\'t in. \n      "At a wine tasting," he said.\n      "On a Wednesday?" I asked.\n      "College professors," he shrugged.\n      We climbed a staircase toward his bedroom, and I tried to ignore the unsettling feeling that this was the first and the last time I entered his family home. I tried to engrave in my memory the photographs that surrounded me. The teenaged User , with the unruly mass of springy yellow curls and the cast on his arm from that eleventh-grade car accident. The father and the mother and the two baby boys. The chubby middle schooler with a gap-toothed smile holding a hesitant gaze at the camera. I wondered, and then hated myself for wondering, if I would ever hear the stories hanging in frames on the walls. \n      When we reached his bedroom, and I saw the suitcase and the duffle bag and the brown cardboard boxes stacked by his closet, the numbness I felt that afternoon was swiftly replaced by a searing pain.\n      "Ouch," I said.\n       User slumped on his unmade bed. \n      "Yeah," he eyed his luggage. "I never really unpacked after graduation."\n      He lifted his arms and looked long at me, as if commanding me to him. Against what was left of my self-preservation, I crawled into his bed.\n***\n      "This really sucks," User said against my shoulder. His breath rose goosebumps on my bare skin.\n      "It doesn\'t have to suck," I stared at his suitcase. "You\'re the one who\'s ending it."\n      "Please don\'t say that," he said. Something in his voice turned my gaze toward him.\n      His eyes were wide open. Wider than I\'d ever seen them.\n      "I\'m not ending it, necessarily," he said. \n      "You want to do long distance?" \n      "I don\'t know if that\'s a good idea," he said.\n      "So you\'re ending it," I said.\n      "I\'m not ending it." This he said with such conviction, he almost growled. \n      "So, you wanna check out your California options first," I pictured girls with full lips and tiny waists and hair to their hips. User \'s words rang in my ears. Once a fuckboy, always a fuckboy.\n      " User ," he groaned. "Please. Look at it from my perspective. What if you met a brilliant, hilarious girl, six months removed from a traumatic life event, who told you she wanted to give up all her potential to clean your dirty dishes? Would you just let her do that?"\n      "Yes?" \n      He sat up. \n      I sat up beside him.\n      "No," he said. \n      "Well, I don\'t know," I finally said. "It\'s not like I have ever been opposed to California. I applied to work at the Griffith Observatory a few months ago."\n      He smiled.\n      "You never told me that?" \n      "I was rejected before we met," I said. "It\'s ok, though, it would have been doing basically the same thing I\'m doing at Newton. Not a huge loss."\n      He glanced at the sheets on his bed and then back at me and then at his sheets again. He ran his fingers through his hair. It looked as if he added several numbers in his head\n      "Ok," he said. "You can stay with me in California."\n      "What?"\n      My heart thumped wildly in my chest.\n      "But I have a few conditions first."\n      "Sure, what, anything?" I stuttered.\n      "We break up first," he said.\n      "Are you playing a fucking game here-" \n      "Listen," he said. "This is an uneven playing field. I know exactly what I want. I want you to have at least a foggy idea of what you want, besides me," he said. \n      "So how is breaking up going to help any of that?"\n      "I think there might be a possibility that I\'m distracting you from meeting the you, you need to be."\n      "That sounds like some misplaced self-help garbage, User ."\n      "It might be," he shrugged. "Maybe I\'m wrong about and you just want to be my housewife forever."\n      "Would you be good with that?" I tried to suppress the hope I felt building in my chest.\n      He smiled a crooked smile.\n      "I\'m 99% sure I won\'t have to worry about that, because I\'m 99% sure I\'m not wrong about you. But to prove it, we have to break up. Eliminate variables."\n      "So we break up, and then what?" I shrugged.\n      "Six months of no-to-limited contact. Then, I\'ll call you. If you\'ve actually tried to figure stuff out and you realized there\'s nothing out there for you and you say, \' User , all I want to do is clean bongs,\' I\'ll book you the next available flight to me." He chuckled. \n      "You know there\'s nothing wrong with that," I said, "being a homemaker."\n      "Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with it," he said. "It\'s just not you."\n      "It\'s not what you think I am," I said. \n      "Right," he said.\n      "So what if you\'re right about me and suddenly I decide I want to climb the corporate ladder?"\n      "Well, I guess then we decide what you want to do," he said. "If you wanna move out to California then, we\'ll do a job search. Or if you want to go to grad school, we\'ll put in an application to Berkeley."\n      "Yeah, right," I smirked.\n      "No," he said, "really."\n      "Well what are you going to do for the next six months? You\'re really going to wait all that time for me?"\n      "Why not?" he shrugged. \n      "You promise you\'ll actually call me in six months?" I could almost feel the skeptical expression on my face.\n      "If you promise that while we\'re apart, you\'ll only do things that are healthy for you."\n      He held out a pinky. \n      I laced mine around his.\n      I knew in my gut this wasn\'t a promise I could keep.\n***'
